CL:0002519 : interrenal epithelial cell   
OLD: The interrenal epithelial kidney cell is an epithelial cell found in the anterior kidney of teleosts fish. This cell type is arranged in layers around the posterior cardinal vein and contains many mitochondria with tubulovesicular cristae. Interrenal chromaffin cells are interspersed among the tissue layer created by this cell type.
