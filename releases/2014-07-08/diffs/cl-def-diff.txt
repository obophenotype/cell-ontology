CL:0000056 : myoblast   
OLD: A precursor cell of the myogenic lineage that develops from the mesoderm. They undergo proliferation, migrate to their various sites, and then differentiate into the appropriate form of myocytes.
NEW: A cell that is commited to differentiating into a muscle cell.  Embryonic myoblasts develop from the mesoderm. They undergo proliferation, migrate to their various sites, and then differentiate into the appropriate form of myocytes.  Myoblasts also occur as transient populations of cells in muscles undergoing repair.


CL:0000355 : multi-potent skeletal muscle stem cell   
(was skeletal muscle stem cell)
OLD: A multifate stem cell found in skeletal muscle than can differentiate into many different cell types. Distinct cell type from satellite cell.
NEW: A multifate stem cell found in skeletal muscle than can differentiate into many different cell types, including muscle. Distinct cell type from satellite cell.


CL:0000594 : skeletal muscle satellite cell   
OLD: An elongated, spindle-shaped, quiescent myoblast that are located between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of the muscle fibres. They are thought to play a role in muscle repair and regeneration.
NEW: An elongated, spindle-shaped, cell that is located between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of a muscle fiber. These cells are mostly quiescent, but upon activation they divide to produce cells that generate new muscle fibers.
