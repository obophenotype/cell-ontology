Mononuclear phagocytes are characterized by the presence of a single, large nucleus. The ‘Mononuclear Phagocyte System’ nomenclature was introduced to distinguish mononuclear monocytes and macrophages from other cells with multiple nuclei. However, the cells within the mononuclear phagocyte system represent a highly heterogeneous group, all of which are able to perform highly efficient phagocytosis - engulfing and digesting microbes and cellular debris to fight infections and to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. 
In addition to phagocytosis, mononuclear phagocytes also secrete chemical compounds to recruit other immune cells to a site of infection. These cells produce different types of signaling molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, triggering a cascade of responses to ensure rapid and efficient containment and neutralization of invading pathogens. These cells are also involved in antigen presentation, a process essential for stimulating an adaptive immune response. They can process and present antigens to T cells, thereby linking the innate and adaptive immune responses.
Mononuclear phagocytes play key roles in tissue repair and remodeling. After infection or injury, these cells help in the clearance of dead cells and debris, a crucial step in the initiation of tissue remodeling and the resolution of inflammation. Overall, mononuclear phagocytes are versatile cells that have tailored their functions to meet the unique challenges of different tissues within the body. They are pivotal in homeostasis, immunity, and inflammation, making them important aspects in a range of human diseases including infection, autoimmunity, and cancer.

They constitute approximately half of the total cells in the human brain and more than half in other parts of the nervous system. Glial cells perform several key functions including, but not limited to, maintaining homeostasis, forming the myelin sheath around the neuron axons, and providing support and nutrition to neurons.
These different functions are performed by various glial cell types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and other specialized types. Astrocytes, for example, are the most abundant glial cells and provide metabolic and nutrient support to neurons, help regulate the extracellular ion and neurotransmitter levels, and play a role in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, contributing to the overall homeostasis and functioning of the nervous system. Additionally, astrocytes are involved in synaptic communication and participate in processes such as synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning.
Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system function to insulate neurons by producing a fatty substance known as myelin. The myelin sheath enhances the speed and efficiency of nerve impulse conduction along the axons. 
Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, protect neurons from pathogens and clear away dead neurons through phagocytosis, a process also known as cellular eating. They also contribute to the regulation of inflammation in response to signals of tissue damage or infection in the central nervous system by releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules that modulate the immune response.
Despite their overarching function in the support and protection of neurons, glial cells have also been shown to play significant roles in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and multiple sclerosis.

These cells are named after their location in the intestines (“entero”) and because they are stainable by chromium salts (“chromaffin”). 
The primary function of type EC enteroendocrine cells is to act as chemosensors and lies in their capacity to produce and secrete serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in modulating motility, secretion, vasodilation, perception of pain, and appetite in the gastrointestinal system. However, its function is not limited to the gastrointestinal tract; once secreted, serotonin is distributed via the bloodstream and contributes to regulating mood, appetite, and sleep in the brain. 
Via specific chemosensory receptors type EC enteroendocrine cells are able to respond to various environmental, metabolic, and homeostatic stimuli and transduce information from the gut to the nervous system: Food intake, particularly the ingestion of fats and carbohydrates, prompts these cells to produce and release serotonin; the mechanical stimulus of food in the lumen can also trigger release. The distribution, function, and responsiveness of type EC cells reveal them as a crucial link between the intestinal environment, the nervous system, and the regulation of numerous bodily functions.

They are characterized by specific surface markers including: F4/80-positive, CD11b-/low, CD11c-positive, CD68-positive, sialoadhesin-positive, dectin-1-positive, MR-positive, CX3CR1-negative. These specialized immune cells form a crucial part of the body's defense mechanism, playing important roles in pulmonary health and homeostasis. They are the first line of defense in the pulmonary immune response, acting as scavengers that patrol the alveoli and engulf foreign particles like bacteria, dust, and other debris that enter the lungs through inhalation.
The primary function of these alveolar macrophages is phagocytosis, whereby they consume and digest foreign substances, dead cells, and other particulates. In the lung, alveolar macrophages are also responsible for clearing surfactant. Additionally, alveolar macrophages also play an integral role in initiating the immune response, as they secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit other immune cells to the site of infection or inflammation.
Beyond their role in host defense, alveolar macrophages contribute to tissue remodeling and wound repair in the lungs, aiding in maintaining lung integrity. They also regulate local inflammation and control the immune response to prevent excessive inflammation that may be harmful. However, an imbalance in the function of alveolar macrophages can contribute to various lung diseases. Abnormal alveolar macrophage activation has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as emphysema, asthma, and fibrosis.

These cells play a critical role in creating a barrier between the lymphatic system and the surrounding tissues. They are structurally different from the endothelial cells of the blood vessels due to the presence of anchoring filaments and lack of a continuous basement membrane, and have a unique phenotype marked by the expression of various cell-specific markers such as Prox-1, VEGFR-3, and LYVE-1.
A significant function of these endothelial cells is to maintain the fluid balance within the body. They facilitate the uptake of excess interstitial fluid that collects in the body tissues, and ensure its transport back into the bloodstream via the lymphatic vessels. These cells also enable the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system, and their subsequent transport in the form of chyle, a milky fluid, to the blood.
Furthermore, endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels play a pivotal role in the body's immune response. They enable the passage of lymphocytes, that are crucial for the body's defense mechanism, from the tissues into the lymph where these cells are activated to fight against foreign bodies and infections. Also, they regulate inflammation reactions by controlling the migration of inflammatory cells, and are thus involved in pathological conditions with an inflammatory component. Lastly, these cells have been noted for their involvement in various disease states related to tissue edema, metastasis, and tumor growth, thus highlighting their importance in both health and disease states.

Through a complex process called spermatogenesis in the testes male germ cells undergo several stages of development, each with distinctive morphological and physiological characteristics, eventually differentiating into mature spermatozoa (sperm). 
Male germ cells are responsible for transferring genetic material from male to offspring as part of sexual reproduction. In the initial stage of their life cycle, they exist as spermatogonial stem cells, which multiply by mitotic division to self-renew and to produce daughter cells. The daughter cells then undergo meiotic division, a process that reduces the number of chromosomes in each cell by half, from diploid to haploid – the formation of spermatids. This is critical for maintaining genetic stability from generation to generation, as it ensures that when an egg and sperm cell unite during fertilization, the resulting offspring will have the correct number of chromosomes. The final phase of spermatogenesis is called spermiogenesis, during which spermatozoa - mature and motile sperm cells – are produced from round spermatids. 
The matured male germ cells or sperm cells are highly specialized, having a streamlined shape designed for efficient movement towards the female egg. A sperm cell is divided into three main parts, namely the head, midpiece, and tail. The head contains the genetic material, the midpiece contains mitochondria that provide energy, and the tail, termed as the flagellum, propels the sperm cell forward. Each of these parts play significant roles in fertilization.

Produced in the male reproductive organs, specifically the testes, sperm cells play an important role in the process of fertilization, where they fuse with a female gamete or egg cell (ovum) to form a zygote, which marks the beginning of a new organism.
Sperm cells hold several unique traits that set them apart from other body cells. Structurally, a sperm cell possesses two main structures: the head, containing the nucleus carrying the paternal genetic information, and the flagellum, which generates energy and grants the sperm cell mobility
The process of fertilization occurs when one sperm cell successfully penetrates the egg, delivering its genetic information, and ultimately leading to the formation of a new individual combining both paternal and maternal genetic materials. Notably, while hundreds of millions of sperm cells may be released during ejaculation, only one has the opportunity to successfully fertilize the egg, underscoring the highly competitive nature of this biological process.

They are an integral part of the mononuclear phagocyte system and are responsible for the phagocytosis of dead or dying cells, microbes, and other foreign substances. Kupffer cells account for approximately 80-90% of tissue-resident macrophages in the body. They are found within the lumen of liver sinusoids and interface with microbial populations and products.
The primary role of Kupffer cells is to maintain homeostasis in the liver. They continuously filter and cleanse the blood that flows through the liver, removing pathogens, endotoxins, particulate matter, aged and dysfunctional red blood cells, and miscellaneous waste products. These cells also play an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis. During the process of phagocytosis, Kupffer cells recycle iron from degraded red blood cells, which is then utilized in the formation of new erythrocytes.
Kupffer cells also play key roles in various immune responses and inflammatory processes. They secrete various types of cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the activation and mobilization of other immune cells. They can also produce reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, which have microbicidal actions. Although their activity is essential for host defense, excessive or prolonged activation of Kupffer cells may contribute to hepatic injury, inflammation, and fibrosis.

They are distinguished from other cells by their large size and their unique ability to secrete enzymes and acids that dissolve the calcium phosphate in bone. The formation of osteoclasts is influenced by two primary factors: macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the ligand-activated receptor (RANKL) of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).
Osteoclasts also collaborate with osteoblasts, responsible for new bone formation, to maintain bone health and adapt bone structure. Their coordinated actions allow continuous remodeling while preserving overall bone strength and integrity. Imbalances in osteoclast activity can lead to pathological conditions. For example, excessive activity may contribute to diseases like osteoporosis, periprosthetic osteolysis, bone tumors, and Paget's disease. Other the other hand, osteoclast deficiency ca result in conditions like osteopetrosis.

They are critical during the early stages of embryonic development, where they delineate and create the organism's exterior body plan. Beyond forming the organism's physical exterior, surface ectodermal cells have other significant roles. For instance, these cells lead to the development of the anterior pituitary gland and the enamel of the teeth. They are also integral to the formation of the sensory organs, including the eyes and the ears. In the eyes, they form the cornea and lens epithelium. In the ears, they form the external ear canal and certain parts of the inner ear. Therefore, these cells are instrumental in the development of various sensory systems in an organism.
Certain abnormalities or mutations in surface ectodermal cells could lead to medical conditions known as ectodermal dysplasias. These are a group of inherited disorders affecting the development or function of teeth, hair, nails, and sweat glands. Therefore, understanding the formation and function of surface ectodermal cells is also important in identifying and addressing certain genetic disorders and conditions. In summary, surface ectodermal cells are essential in embryonic development, contributing to the creation of the external physical appearance and the sensory organs of an organism.

They are a critical part of the vertebrate nervous system as they provide the only signal output from the cortex to the cerebellar nuclei. They are one of the few types of neurons that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. The most distinct hallmark of Purkinje cells is their elaborate dendritic arbor, which forms a broad and intricately branching structure resembling a tree. These numerous branches each receive excitatory synaptic inputs from more than 100,000 parallel fibers; in addition, a single climbing fiber makes hundreds of synapses to the soma and proximal dendrites. A single long axon forms an inhibitory projection to the cerebellar nuclei.
Purkinje cells play key roles in the coordination of fine, voluntary motor movements and balance. As the sole output of all motor coordination in the cerebellar cortex, they serve as a central relay in the cerebro-cerebellar loop. Each Purkinje cell receives two types of synaptic input: one from parallel fibers (which are axons of granule cells), and the other from climbing fibers (originating from the inferior olivary nucleus). The Purkinje cells process and integrate these diverse kinds of input signals to generate output that controls timing and coordination of movements.
Purkinje neurons show considerable synaptic plasticity. Throughout life, these cells continue to undergo long-term potentiation and depression at parallel fiber synapses, which cause long-lasting increase or decrease, respectively, of synaptic transmission and have been proposed as mechanisms for motor learning. 
Purkinje cells are also known to be implicated in a variety of diseases. Their progressive loss is a prime feature in certain types of ataxia, a collective term used to describe conditions characterized by loss of muscular control and coordination. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the density of Purkinje cells has been reported in conditions such as autism and Huntington’s disease.

Classified among the resident immune cells, microglial cells represent about 10% of all cells found within the CNS. These cells are derived from progenitor cells in the yolk sac, which differentiates them from other types of glial cells (such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) that are derived from neuroectodermal cell lineages. 
The primary role of microglial cells is to act as the first and main active form of immune defense in the CNS. They express a vast repertoire of pattern recognition receptors, which allow them to sense and eliminate microbes invading the CNS parenchyma. They represent one of the macrophage populations of the CNS and are responsible for phagocytosis (engulfing and destroying cellular waste or pathogens) in the neural environment. 
Microglial cells are particularly responsive to pathogens and injuries and change their morphology in reaction to inflammation or insult: In the normal state they are characterized by a ramified shape with small processes; in response to stimuli, some microglia mature and change to an amoeboid shape. 
Beyond their macrophagic activity, they also perform synaptic pruning during brain development, eliminate unnecessarily produced neurons, and facilitate tissue regeneration and repair. they play integral roles in regulating neural development and supporting cell survival and are important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. 
While their protective role generally benefits the brain, their over-activation can occasionally lead to neuro-inflammatory diseases, underlining the importance of balanced microglial cell functions. They have been extensively studied for their association with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

These cells plays an integral role in various physiological and metabolic functions, actively participating in nutrient absorption, host defense, and vascular homeostasis in the gut.
The primary function of gut endothelial cells lies in their ability to control the passage of materials and the transit of white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. They achieve this through the formation of a semi-permeable barrier, in which permeability is regulated by tight junctions; complex structures that bring the cells together, sealing the space between them. This ensures a controlled, selective passage of nutrients, ions, and water from the bloodstream into the gut and vice versa, helping maintain homeostasis and overall health.
Gut endothelial cells also play a significant role in angiogenesis and serve as a critical regulator of the gut immune responses playing a modulative role in gut immune homeostasis and inflammatory responses. In addition, they generate nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, which helps in maintaining vascular tonus, preventing platelet and leukocyte adhesion, and decreasing smooth muscle proliferation. These multi-faceted roles make gut endothelial cells indispensable for the normal functioning of the gut and overall health.

The presence and distribution of this pigment play a crucial role in the body's defense mechanism against harmful ultraviolet radiation.
In addition to melanin production, melanocytes also engage in a variety of other biological functions. They play a fundamental role in the immune response, owing to their ability to present antigens to T cells. Furthermore, they contribute to the maintenance of the skin's homeostasis by regulating processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cytokine production. A balance in melanocyte function is pivotal, as dysfunctions often result in dermatological disorders. For instance, the loss of melanocytes or reduction in their function may lead to hypopigmentation conditions such as vitiligo, whereas an abnormal increase could result in hyperpigmentation disorders or melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer.

The term \"goblet\" refers to their shape, which resembles a flask or goblet, specially at their apical end which is swollen due to the accumulation of secretory granules. 
The primary function of goblet cells is to to protect and lubricate the underlying tissues by secreting large quantities of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, which forms mucus when hydrated. In the respiratory tract, the mucus secreted by these cells traps dust, bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful particles in the inhaled air, preventing them from reaching the delicate tissues of the lungs. In the intestines, the goblet cells secrete mucus that acts as a protective barrier shielding the intestinal epithelium from dietary antigens, pathogens and prevents the intestinal epithelium from being eroded by the actions of the digestive enzymes and the abrasive action of passing food material.
Goblet cells are capable of rapidly altering their secretory output in response to stimuli. For example, irritants like smoke or dust can trigger an increased rate of mucus production, as the body attempts to flush out the harmful particles. Conversely, in conditions such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis, overactive goblet cells can create a thick accumulation of mucus that obstructs the airways and fosters bacterial growth. Lastly, goblet cells are not static, rather, they undergo a dynamic process known as goblet cell metaplasia-differentiation, wherein non-goblet cells in response to chronic injury or inflammation, can differentiate into goblet cells leading to an accumulation of these cells in the tissue, known as goblet cell hyperplasia.

Constituting less than 1% of the total population of intestinal cells, they are differentiated from a common intestinal cell progenitor, thus sharing lineage with absorptive and goblet cells of the intestines.
The distinct characteristic feature of an enteroendocrine cell is its inherent capacity to synthesize and secrete a plethora of gut hormones such as serotonin, somatostatin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin, secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, motilin, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Integrated within this complex network of signaling agents, these substances control various aspects of the digestive system. Each enteroendocrine cell has its unique combination of hormones to release, determined by its position along the intestinal tract. Intriguingly, these hormones not only modulate local gut function, including motility, absorption and secretion, but also potentiate distant actions on other systems such as endocrine, nervous and immune and play a role in the feeling of satiety.
The release of these hormones from enteroendocrine cells is a highly regulated and dynamic process. The cells are equipped with sensory receptors localized on its luminal side that respond to various stimuli, including changes in nutrient composition, chemical or mechanical changes in the gut lumen, or even signals arising from commensal microbiota. This sensory input stimulates a signaling cascade within the cell, culminating in the release of specific hormones into the interstitial fluid. These hormones then make their way into the bloodstream, acting on their respective target receptors to mediate their duties. The multifunctional characteristics of enteroendocrine cells make them crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis and the overall physiological well being of the body.

Chromaffin cells are also found in small clusters, known as paraganglia, in various locations throughout the body, including the sympathetic nervous system. They derive their name from their ability to stain a brownish-black color upon exposure to chromic salts, a feature made possible due to their high content of granules rich in catecholamines and catecholamine-related neurotransmitters.
The primary function of chromaffin cells is the synthesis and release of catecholamines, specifically epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). These neurotransmitters are vital stress hormones that, when released by the adrenal chromaffing cells into the bloodstream, prepare the body for the 'fight or flight' response. This response can enhance the body's performance in a dangerous situation by increasing heart rate, elevating blood sugar, and increasing blood flow to the muscles. The chromaffin cells in paraganglia are responsible for the local release of catecholamines and play a role in regulating blood pressure and other autonomic functions.
In addition to their role in stress response, chromaffin cells also contribute to the body's immune response. They secrete several peptides including antimicrobial peptides, and the discovery of LPS and cytokine receptors on chromaffin cells suggests that the adrenal medulla may participate in some aspects of the immune response.

They are named after Franz Leydig, a German anatomist who discovered these cells in 1850. Uniquely situated within the soft connective tissue surrounding the seminiferous tubules, Leydig cells form an integral part of the male reproductive system. They are usually polygonal cells characterized by well developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, high lipid content and a large round nucleus. They are found across mammalian species, including humans. 
The primary function of Leydig cells is the production of androgens, the male sex hormones, the most notable of which is testosterone. Leydig cells synthesize testosterone from cholesterol through a series of enzymatic reactions. The production and release of testosterone are mainly regulated by the luteinizing hormone (LH) released by the anterior pituitary gland. In response to LH, Leydig cells convert cholesterol into testosterone, which then plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of primary and secondary male sexual characteristics. These include the formation and maturation of male reproductive organs, onset of spermatogenesis, and the presentation of male secondary sexual traits such as the deepening of the voice, growth of facial hair, development of muscles, and a broadening of shoulders.
Apart from testosterone production, Leydig cells also secrete insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3) that is essential for testicular descent during embryonic development in males. Dysregulation or loss of Leydig cells can lead to numerous conditions like testosterone deficiency, infertility, and certain forms of testicular cancer. Although not typical, Leydig cells can regenerate if they are damaged, ensuring the continuous production of testosterone and maintaining male reproductive health. They provide an excellent model to study cell differentiation and hormone regulation, thereby enhancing our understanding of reproductive biology and associated disorders.

Dimensions of mature hepatocytes typically range from 20 to 30 μm in humans, but size may vary depending on their location within the liver lobule. Hepatocytes are characterized by high biosynthetic, enzymatic, and endocytic activity. They contain abundant mitochondria, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and a large nucleus that is often binucleate. 
The liver consists of three zones - the periportal Zone 1, midzone 2, and pericentral Zone 3 - which have differential nutrient and oxygen status, and damage susceptibility; hepatocytes in the different zones show signifcant functional heterogeneity ('hepatocyte functional zonation'). Hepatocytes are involved in a multitude of critical functions including the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, the synthesis of serum proteins (e.g., albumin, transferrin, and lipoproteins), the detoxification and excretion of endogenous and exogenous substances, the storage of vitamins and minerals, and the production and secretion of bile. 
Heterocytes demonstrate a remarkable regenerative capacity, which enables the liver to recover from injury and loss of tissue mass. Notably, hepatocytes perform biotransformation with both phase I and phase II enzymes, which modify drugs, xenobiotics, and various substances for elimination from the body. Phase I enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, catalyze both oxidative and reductive reactions of many xenobiotics; many of the products of phase I enzymes are substrates for the phase II enzymes, which catalyze conjugation reactions. 
Alterations in hepatocyte function have significant implications for overall human health and disease. Certain conditions, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, can profoundly affect hepatocyte structure and function, thereby disrupting the liver's ability to perform its vital roles within the body. As the primary site for drug metabolism, changes in hepatocyte function can also impact the effectiveness and toxicity of pharmaceuticals. The regenerative ability of hepatocytes makes them valuable cells for liver regenerative medicine and bioartificial liver support systems, and their study has provided significant insights into liver biology and disease.

These elongated, multi-nucleated cells convert ATP into mechanical energ and are key for voluntary movement and posture. They also are responsible for maintaining body temperature, storing nutrients, and stabilizing joints.
Skeletal muscle cells organize themselves tightly into bundles to form muscle fibers. Embedded within each of these cells are thousands of myofibrils, which are made up of the contractile proteins, actin (the thin filament), and myosin (the thick filament). Contraction of a skeletal muscle cell occurs when these myofibrils shorten, a process driven by the sliding of actin and myosin filaments over each other in a mechanism famously known as the sliding filament theory.
Additionally, skeletal muscle cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity, which allows for their adaptation in response to alterations in functional demands or damages. They have an innate regenerative capacity due to the presence of satellite cells—quiescent muscle stem cells that reside within the muscle fibers. Upon muscle injury, these satellite cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into new muscle cells, thereby contributing to the repair and growth of injured skeletal muscle. With this, skeletal muscle cells serve not only a pivotal biomechanical function but also possess a great capacity for self-healing and regeneration.

They are also referred to as type I, slow-twitch, or red muscles because of their high myoglobin content which gives them a dark, reddish appearance. These cells are predominantly found in the postural muscles of the body, such as those in the back and lower limbs. 
A defining characteristic of slow muscle cells is their significant resistance to fatigue. This is largely due to their efficient oxidative metabolism, which allows them to continuously contract over extended periods without succumbing to fatigue. This extraordinary endurance is facilitated by a high concentration of mitochondria, which enables the efficient use of oxygen for energy production, and capillaries, which supplies the necessary oxygen and nutrients. Additionally, these cells have an abundant supply of myoglobin, a protein that stores and transports oxygen within the muscle cell, further supporting their aerobic metabolism.
The primary role of slow muscle cells in the human body is to provide sustained, low-intensity contractions over a prolonged period. They are responsible for maintaining posture and providing stability, rather than delivering short, powerful bursts of activity. They play a pivotal role in supporting various physical activities such as standing, walking, or any form of exercise that requires endurance over speed.

These cells are primarily found within skeletal muscle groups that are directly involved in gross motor activities, such as running, jumping, or lifting heavy weights. The designation \"fast\" refers to their speed of contraction in response to neural stimuli, which is significantly quicker when compared to other muscle cell types such as slow-twitch or type I muscle fibers.
The primary function of fast muscle cells revolves around their role in anaerobic metabolism, which provides the energy needed for short, forceful bursts of power. They contain a high concentration of glycolytic enzymes that facilitate this process, leading to a swift break down of glucose to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency in biological systems. On the downside, the byproduct of this very rapid, anaerobic metabolic process is lactic acid, which can build up and cause muscle fatigue. 
Fast muscle cells can be further classified into two subtypes based on their metabolic characteristics: type IIa and type IIb/x. Type IIa cells, also known as fast oxidative-glycolytic fibers, possess a good oxygen supply and can function in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, exhibiting moderate resistance to fatigue. On the other hand, type IIb/x cells, also known as fast glycolytic fibers, primarily rely on anaerobic metabolism and tire out a lot quicker. Both these subtypes can adapt to changing demands due to exercise and conditioning, highlighting the plasticity that is a key characteristic of these versatile muscle cells.

These cells are an essential component of the autonomic nervous system controling involuntary movements within the body.
Smooth muscle cells play a vital role in many physiological processes due to their unique functionality. They can contract and relax in a slow, sustained, and controlled manner to help modulate the size and shape of the lumens of the organs they surround. For example, in the digestive system, coordinated contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells propels food along the gastrointestinal tract - a process known as peristalsis. In the blood vessels, the smooth muscle cells, by contracting or relaxing, either constrict or dilate the vessels, which in turn, help regulate blood flow and pressure.
On a cellular level, smooth muscle cells possess a single, centrally located nucleus and contain an arranged network of actin and myosin filaments, which are the proteins responsible for muscle contraction. Unlike their counterparts in skeletal or cardiac muscles, these cells lack specific contact points for these filaments, hence the lack of visible striations. Furthermore, the contraction of smooth muscle cells is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, adding an additional layer of complex regulation to these highly specialized cells.

These cells are haploid, containing half the genome or only one set of chromosomes, which is a contrast to the diploid state (two sets of chromosomes) found in most cells in a multicellular organism. This reduction in genetic material is crucial since it allows for the re-establishment of the diploid number of chromosomes when two gametes merge to form a diploid zygote during fertilization.
There are two major types of gametes in animals: sperm cells in males and egg (or ova) in females. These gametes contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the offspring but are morphologically and functionally distinct. Sperm cells (or spermatozoa) are characterized by their motility, small size, and large quantities; they are produced continuously in vast numbers through a process called spermatogenesis in the male gonads or testes. Female gametes are much larger, fewer in numbers, and are not motile; they undergo a development process known as oogenesis, which takes place within the ovaries. The egg also contributes most of the cytoplasm and organelles (including mitochondria) to the zygote that are required for initial cell division stages after fertilization.
Gametes have a primary role in sexual reproduction and genetic variation, which aids in evolution. The formation of gametes involves a special type of cell division called meiosis that introduces genetic diversity via the process of recombination and independent assortment. Following the fusion of male and female gametes, the combination of paternal and maternal genetic material in the zygote allows for genetic recombination, which is a fundamental source of genetic variation and, thus, evolution. Therefore, gametes not only are critical to the inception of new individuals but also contribute to species survival and evolution.

They derive their name from the predominantly smooth appearance under microscopic examination, as opposed to the striated appearance of cardiac and skeletal muscles.  
A principal function of VSMCs is to regulate vascular tone, which directly dictates blood pressure and blood flow distribution across various body parts. This is achieved through coordinated contraction and relaxation of the muscles in response to a variety of extracellular signals. When a blood vessel is exposed to stimuli like pressure or injury, VSMCs contract, resulting in vasoconstriction and ultimately, an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, in response to vasodilators, these cells relax, leading to vasodilation and a consequent decrease in blood pressure.
VSMCs are also involved in vascular remodeling, a process where blood vessels adapt their structure to long-term changes in hemodynamic conditions or disease states. In diseases like atherosclerosis and hypertension, an aberrant proliferative and synthetic phenotype of VSMCs contributes to the formation of plaques, leading to vessel hardening or even occlusion. Recent research has further implicated these cells in immune responses, recognizing their function in leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, factors that are largely instrumental in vascular pathologies.

The male gamete is distinguished by its morphology, notably its elongated shape which is geared towards locomotion. One of the primary characteristics of a male gamete is its flagellum, or tail, which propels the cell towards the female gamete. It additionally contains an elongated head region housing the nucleus, where the genetic material is stored. The anterior section of the head, the acrosome, releases enzymes essential for penetrating the protective layers of the ovum during the fertilization process.
The function of male gametes does not cease upon fertilization. In addition to delivering the paternal set of chromosomes, fusion of the sperm cell with the ovum causes an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ which then activates the female egg cell to undergo the so-called cortical reaction during which the egg’s zona pellucida is changed so fusion with additional sperm is prevented. The Ca2+ signal also initiates the development of the zygote and eventual formation of an embryo. Male gametes also contribute towards forming the placenta, which supplies nutrients and removes waste products during gestation.

One of the primary roles of granulosa cells is to aid in the production and secretion of sex hormones, particularly estrogen. They achieve this by working in tandem with theca cells, which stay attached to the external layer of the follicle. Theca cells produce androstenedione (a type of androgen) which granulosa cells then convert into estradiol, a form of estrogen, with the help of the enzyme aromatase. Moreover, granulosa cells participate in luteinization, transforming into luteal granulosa cells as a response to the luteinizing hormone during ovulation. This allows the formation of the corpus luteum, responsible for the secretion of progesterone necessary to maintain pregnancy.
Granulosa cells also play a significant role in follicular development and oocyte maturation, involving close communication with the contained oocyte. They support the oocyte through the provision of nutrients and growth factors, control its meiotic cycle and ensure it is appropriately oriented and instructed for impending ovulation. Furthermore, granulosa cells contribute to the formation of the zona pellucida and the follicular fluid, providing an optimal environment for the oocyte's growth and maturation. These cells, thus, perform multiple vital roles, underscoring their importance in fertility and reproductive health.

Functionally, these effects are aimed at sustaining nutrient absorption to optimize energy extraction from consumed food.
In the pancreas, D cells maintain a vital role in endocrine regulation. D cells in the pancreatic islands secrete somatostatin to inhibit the release of both insulin and glucagon from type A cells and B cells, glucoregulatory hormones that control blood sugar levels.

Paneth cells are characterized by large acidophilic granules, which take up most of the cytoplasmic volume, causing the nucleus to be pushed toward the base of the cell.
Paneth cells function as a part of the innate immune system. The large granules inside the cells are filled with antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and lysozymes. Upon bacterial intrusion or cellular signaling indicating a potential infection, Paneth cells release the granules containing the antimicrobial substances into the crypt lumen, effectively serving as the first line of defense against bacterial invasion within the gastrointestinal tract. In essence, Paneth cells serve as guardians, protecting the intestinal stem cells from harmful pathogens that may disturb the gut ecosystem.
In addition to their primary role in immunity, Paneth cells are also crucial for supporting the stem cell niche in the intestinal crypts. They are located adjacent to Lgr5+ stem cells and secrete various growth factors such as EGF, TGF-alpha, Wnt3, and Notch ligand Dll4.

Smooth muscle myoblasts arise from the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, a process tightly regulated by specific genetic factors and environmental signals. Their role extends to myogenesis, particularly in the formation of muscular tissue, especially during embryonic development.
Smooth muscle myoblasts possess distinctive cellular characteristics. In contrast to skeletal muscle myoblasts, they do not fuse to create multinucleated fibers. Instead, they differentiate into individual, uninucleated smooth muscle cells. This differentiation unfolds in two distinct phases: proliferation, marked by rapid division to increase cell numbers, and differentiation, involving structural and functional transformation into mature smooth muscle cells. This intricate process is intricately mediated by various signaling molecules and transcription factors.
Functionally, smooth muscle myoblasts and the mature muscle cells they generate play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Smooth muscle cells orchestrate involuntary muscle responses and are integral to body systems that regulate blood flow, propel food along the digestive tract, and control airflow in the respiratory tract. These diverse functions underscore the significance of smooth muscle myoblasts in the body's growth, maintenance, and overall function.

The primary function of SMSCs lies in their capacity to facilitate the growth and repair of damaged skeletal muscle. Upon muscle injury or trauma, these normally quiescent cells activate, proliferate, and differentiate into myoblasts. These myoblasts subsequently mature and fuse to form myotubes, which ultimately help in the repair and rebuilding of muscle fibers. This response is an integral part of the skeletal muscle's ability to recover from injury and adapt to enhanced or changing physical demands, thereby maintaining and improving muscle function.
Furthermore, SMSCs also contribute to hypertrophic muscle growth due to resistance exercise and endurance training, with the notable feature of their multi-nucleated nature resulting from the fusion of differentiated myoblasts. The additional nuclei support enhanced protein synthesis, thus allowing the muscle fibers to grow and strengthen in response to exercise. In aging and in diseases, the number or functionality of these cells can decrease, leading to impaired muscle regeneration and progressive muscle weakness.

Found primarily in the pancreas and salivary glands, the term acinar is derived from the Latin word 'acinus' which means 'grape'; this is because acinar cells are arranged in a grape-like cluster around small ducts, formulating an acinus structure. 
In the salivary glands, acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes as well as other substances such as mucus and water. These secretions service the initial stages of the digestive process, preparing the consumed food for onward digestion in the stomach and intestines by lubricating and partially breaking it down. 
In the pancreas, acinar cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting a significant amount of digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and amylase. These enzymes are stored in zymogen granules inside the acinar cells until they are dispatched into the small intestine. Once within the small intestine, they break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into substances that can be absorbed. This is vital to the effective and efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume. 
Acinar cells have high protein synthesis rates and are susceptible to accumulation of misfolded proteins; the subsequential induction of ER stress is thought to be involved in the development of pancreatitis, a serious inflammatory disease of the exocrine pancreas.

They play an essential role in kidney function, particularly in the filtration selectivity of the glomerulus. Each podocyte is characterized by a unique architecture with a large cell body, ‘major processes’ extending outwardly from the cell body and ‘foot processes’, also known as pedicels, which surround. the glomerular capillary loops
Podocytes represent the last barrier of the glomerular filtration membrane in the kidney. This barrier prevents the leakage of plasma proteins from the blood into the urine, hence maintaining protein homeostasis in the body. The foot processes of the podocytes interdigitate with those from neighboring cells. The cell-cell junctions between the foot processes, the slit-diaphragms, are thought to create a molecular sensor of renal filtration that prevents the passage of macromolecules while allowing water and small solutes to pass.
Podocytes also contribute to the glomerular basement membrane by secreting collagen and maintain glomerular endothelial cell fenestration by secreting VEGFA. They have been shown to play a role in inducing cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, and inflammatory response, consistent with their essential function in the kidney. 
The importance of podocytes is further emphasized by the effects of their damage or loss. Abnormalities in podocytes often result in severe kidney diseases (podocytopathies), including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD). Injury to the podocytes can result in \"effacement\" or flattening of foot processes, leading to increased permeability of the filtration barrier and proteinuria (an excess of serum protein in urine) which is a common symptom of kidney diseases.

These cells are present in various types of epithelial tissues in the human body, including the intestinal tract, endocrine glands, and certain parts of the renal system. 
There are multiple types of endothelial cell fenestrations. The most common type is found in systemic capillaries of the endocrine tissue (e.g., pancreatic islets), gastrointestinal mucosa, and renal peritubular capillaries. Here, the fenestrated cells have fenestrations in their peripheral cytoplasm with a unique thin and permeable diaphragm that provides a high degree of selectivity, blocking the passage of larger molecules while allowing the free movement of smaller ones. In contrast, other types of fenestrations, such as the discontinuous epithelium of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, do not have diaphragms. 
Characteristically, fenestrated cells play a vital role in the filtering process of body systems. They are a key part of the glomeruli in the kidneys where blood is filtered under high pressure. The fenestrations present in the endothelial cells lining the capillaries of the glomerulus allow the free passage of water and small solute molecules towards the Bowman's capsule, leaving behind larger proteins and cells in the blood, thereby aiding in the filtration and waste removal process. 
In the endocrine system, fenestrated cells in glandular capillaries allow the prompt release of hormones into the bloodstream. These cells have tightly clustered fenestrations which increase the surface area available for passive diffusion, improving the efficiency of hormone secretion. In villi of the small intestine, these cells increase absorption efficiency, permitting the exchange of water, electrolytes, and nutrients.
Overall, fenestrated cells contribute immensely to important physiological processes of filtration, absorption, and secretion, primarily connecting our body's circulation system with the surrounding tissues and organs.

M cells are characterized by apical microfolds (hence their alternate name) which express unique adhesion molecules that enable them to sample the luminal macromolecules. 
Other morphological features that distinguish M cells from other intestinal mucosal cells include sparse microvilli and a reduced thickness of the glycocalyx, which permits adhesion while not hindering the transport of molecules. They also have unique intraepithelial invaginations on the basolateral side which are filled with macrophages and other immune cells that can process the engulfed macromolecules quickly. 
These morphological characteristics enable M cells to serve a dual role in immune responses. They initiate the immune response by transporting antigens (such as toxic or pathogenic substances) across the epithelial layer to lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells in the underlying lymphoid tissue. This specialized transport process is called 'transcytosis.' They also have specialized molecules like glycoprotein-2 for bacterial uptake. Simultaneously, M cells help maintain immune tolerance to food antigens and commensal bacteria, preventing unnecessary reactions to non-pathogenic substances and hypersensitivity conditions. While these functions are crucial for well-being, M cell dysfunction can lead to serious conditions like Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases.

They are one of the four main endocrine cell types present in the pancreatic islets, along with type A, B and D cells. PP cells are notable for their production of pancreatic polypeptide, an anorexigenic hormone that modulates food intake and energy homeostasis. 
By secreting pancreatic polypeptide, PP cells play a significant role in the management of both digestive and appetite regulation. Upon ingestion of food, there is a significant increase in the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide, which then reduces biliary secretion and helps slow down the movement of food through the digestive tract. This allows more time for digestion to take place and nutrients to be absorbed, promoting the efficient use of dietary intake. The pancreatic polypeptide further reduces appetite by interacting with the hypothalamus, the area of the brain responsible for control of hunger.
Given their important role in digestion, malfunction or damage to PP cells can lead to a disturbance in the digestive process and contribute to some disease conditions. For example, an overproduction of pancreatic polypeptide can result in conditions such as pancreatic tumors and diabetes. Conversely, an under secretion might contribute to obesity due to impaired dietary control. Furthermore, PP cells may also play a role in the body's energy balance, suggesting their implication in conditions related to energy metabolism.

They form the urothelium, a specialized, multi-layered epithelium that lines major portions of the urinary tract, including the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, and the proximal part of the urethra. The distinct characteristic of urothelial cells is their ability to stretch and contract depending on the volume of liquid they contain - a feature that facilitates the essential role they play in maintaining the functionality and integrity of the urinary system.
The primary function of urothelial cells is to provide an impermeable barrier to urine, preventing the toxic components present in the urine from seeping back into the body's bloodstream. The urothelium consists of a superficial umbrella cell layer, 1–2 layers of intermediate cells, and a basal cell layer. The umbrella layer is composed of large, mostly binucleated cells that are covered in an asymmetrical unit membrane, the uroplakin plaques. These plaques function to seal the apical membrane of the bladder from the toxic and highly variable contents of urine. The lipid bilayer structure of uroplakin plaques has an exceptionally high concentration of uroplakins that contribute to the barrier function of the urothelium.
Beyond their mechanical function, urothelial cells also play a role in sensing and signaling changes in the urinary system. They express a number of sensor molecules or respond to thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli and can release chemical mediators. This allows them to act as sensory transducers because they detect changes in the filling state of the bladder and transmit this information to the nervous system. Moreover, these versatile cells contribute to the defense mechanism against urinary tract pathogens. They respond to bacterial infections by releasing chemical messengers, cytokines and chemokines, to attract immune cells, and also can engulf pathogens via endocytosis.

Their anatomy is composed primarily of densely packed myofibrils, which are protein structures that consist of sarcomeres - the fundamental units of muscle contraction. Cardiac muscle cells are united at their ends through specialized junctions known as intercalated discs, which allow the heart to contract in a unified, powerful and rhythmic way.
Functionally, cardiac muscle cells are responsible for the heart's consistent pumping action that circulates blood throughout the body. Unlike most cells in the body, cardiac muscle cells spontaneously depolarize and generate action potentials without external stimulation. This unique trait stems from the presence of ion channels in the cells' membrane that allow a cyclic flow of ions across the membrane, which create the electrical impulses necessary for heart contraction. The spread of these electrical signals from one cardiac muscle cell to another - facilitated by the interconnected network made by the intercalated disks - results in a synchronized contraction of the heart muscle.
Unlike skeletal muscle cells which can tire and need rest, cardiac muscle cells have to work ceaselessly throughout the entire lifespan, without the opportunity for rest, to ensure continuous circulation of blood. This is made possible through the high volume of mitochondria and a constant supply of oxygen from coronary circulation. In conclusion, cardiac muscle cells, through their unique structure and vital functionality, play a pivotal role in sustaining life by providing the means for blood to reach every cell in the body.

They achieve this by producing a range of signaling molecules, such as nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and numerous cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1, -6 and -12. The release of these potent molecules helps to recruit other immune cells to the site, killing off pathogenic organisms and facilitation inflammation. At the same time, M1 macrophages can also present antigens to T cells, thereby helping to induce an adaptive immune response. Over time, these macrophages may transition in phenotype and function to help resolve the inflammation and promote tissue repair.
Despite the beneficial role of inflammatory macrophages in dealing with pathogens, chronic activation of these cells can lead to harmful effects. Over time, continuous production of pro-inflammatory molecules can cause damage to tissues and organs. This is seen in certain chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and various autoimmune disorders. In such situations, the normally protective function of inflammatory macrophages is not properly controlled, which can contribute to disease pathology.

These immune cells play crucial roles in maintenance and regulation, homeostasis, and disease response, thereby helping in the overall cognitive functioning of an organism. 
There are different macrophage populations in the CNS, often classified into microglial cells, which reside in the parenchyma, and non-parenchymal macrophages at the interface between the brain and the periphery, including the perivascular spaces, the choroid plexus, and the meninges. CNS macrophages are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. CNS macrophages have distinct morphologies: Meningeal and perivascular macrophages have a more elongated shape than microglia, which are characterized by a small cell body with fine processes; in contrast, choroid plexus macrophages typically have a stellate shape.
Microglia are the most abundant abundant mononuclear phagocytes and have been shown to play a number of physiological roles, including proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions, synaptic pruning and remodeling, and apoptotic cell removal through phagocytosis. Non-parenchymal CAMs primarily support the barrier function against external antigens. Meningeal macrophages have been shown to respond to peripheral microbial challenges and to protect the brain against fatal viral infection.
CNS macrophages are also involved in the initiation and progression of many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as multiple sclerosis.

The M1/M2 classification is based upon macrophage polarization rather than macrophage location and refers to macrophage activation towards either a more inflammatory or more resolving phenotype, respectively, although the functional diversity of macrophages is more nuanced than such a dichotomy suggests.
M2 macrophages cells are differentiated from their precursors generally in response to Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interleukin-13 (IL-13). Tissue-resident macrophages are also sometimes said to have an “M2-like” phenotype. M2 macrophages play key roles in immunoregulation and disease resolution.
Functionally, alternatively activated macrophages are essential in wound healing and tissue repair and remodeling, largely due to their potent anti-inflammatory actions and their ability to promote angiogenesis. They achieve these functions by the production of specific growth factors and signaling proteins including Arg1, Ym1/2, Fizz1, and TGF-β. Additionally, they provide defense against specific categories of pathogens, particularly parasites, through specific communication with Th2 cells. 
However, dysfunction of M2 macrophages can be harmful. Alternatively activated macrophages have been associated with several pathological conditions such as asthma, fibrosis, and tumor progression. This is due to their capacity to inhibit inflammatory responses, promote unneeded wound healing processes, and support tumour growth and spreading. Furthermore, complex roles have been observed in metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, showing the diverse functional spectrum of these cells.

They represent the most common type of bone cell, making up approximately 95% of the total bone cell population in mature adult bone tissue. Osteocytes are a stellate shape with numerous long, slender dendritic processes.
The formation of bone is a complex process involving the action of osteoclasts - cells that break down and reabsorb old bone, followed by osteoblasts that rebuild the bone. Osteocytes serve as coordinators for these two types of bone cells to ensure a balance in the bone remodeling process, contributing to maintaining both bone strength and mineral homeostasis.
The primary functions of osteocytes involve the creation, maintenance, and repair of bone tissue. They ensure that bone remodeling is performed by forming a network within the bone and communicating with other cells to help them respond to mechanical strain and damage.
A remarkable aspect of osteocytes is their ability to perceive mechanical forces, translating them into biochemical signals that regulate bone remodeling and adaptation. Defects in osteocyte function, aside from other bone cells, have been associated with several bone disorders such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, and skeletal manifestations of diabetes.

These cells are structurally arranged in small clusters - or acini - with a small central lumen, and their primary function is to produce and secrete enzymes that facilitate digestion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats within the small intestine.
Some of the most important digestive enzymes synthesized by the pancreatic acinar cells include amylase, which digests carbohydrates, lipase, which breaks down fats, and several proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin which are vital for the digestion of proteins. Importantly, these enzymes are produced as proenzymes or zymogens to avoid autolysis, or the breakdown of the pancreas itself.
The release of these enzymes by the pancreatic acinar cells is strictly regulated by hormones and neurochemicals. Cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum cause the release of these enzymes. Moreover, acinar cells also respond to another hormone, secretin, by releasing bicarbonate-rich fluid which helps to neutralize the gastric acid in the duodenum. 
Dysregulation in the function of pancreatic acinar cells can lead to severe health issues, including pancreatitis, which is characterized by inflammatory damage to the organ due to the premature activation of digestive enzymes.

Functionally, these cells are pivotal in glucose metabolism and homeostasis, accounting for about 20% of the total population of cells in the pancreatic islets. 
The primary role of type A enteroendocrine cells involves the synthesis, storage, and secretion of the peptide hormone glucagon, which is critical in energy regulation throughout the body. In response to a decrease in blood glucose levels, the pancreatic A cells are stimulated to secrete glucagon into the bloodstream. Glucagon acts on its target cells, mainly in the liver, to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis processes, thereby increasing blood glucose levels back to normal. In this way, pancreatic A cells play an integral role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing hypoglycemia.
Pancreatic A cells also participate in the local regulation of islet activities as glucagon acts through glucagon receptors on A, B and D type cells within the islets. Recent studies have also shown that Pancreatic A cells play a role in the generation and regeneration of B type cells. Following beta cell injuries pancreatic A cells increase in numbers and produce Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases the proliferation and cytoprotection of beta cells. In response to extreme injury of B type cells pancreatic A cells can transform (transdifferentiate) into functioning B type cells.
Until recently, glucagon has been considered a pancreas-specific hormone; however, extrapancreatic glucagon has been reported in patients who had undergone complete, and glucagon-positive cells been identified in the human stomach, indicating that Type A enteroendocrine cells are not restricted to the pancreas.

Cardiac myocytes connect with each other through specialized structures called intercalated discs, facilitating electrical and mechanical continuity and enabling synchronous contraction of the heart. They also possess a high number of mitochondria to meet their high energy demand for continuous heartbeat action.
Cardiac myocytes are capable of automaticity, meaning they have the unique ability to spontaneously and rhythmically generate their electrical impulses, a characteristic led by pacemaker cells. The electrical signals initiated and propagated in these cells are responsible for heartbeats. They also respond to the electrical signals transmitted by the autonomic nervous system and chemical signals like hormones. Thus, cardiac myocytes not only participate in maintaining the heart’s function but also play a role in modulating heart rate and strength of contraction in response to the body's changing needs. Consequently, malfunction of these cells leads to serious cardiac diseases such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

Additionally, endowed with inherent rhythmic electrical activity, atrial myocytes contribute significantly to the initiation and propagation of the heart’s electrical impulses.
A distinguishing feature that separates atrial myocytes from other cardiac myocytes is their ability to synthesize and secrete atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in response to atrial stretch or dilatation. ANP acts as a potent vasodilator and diuretic, helping to maintain blood pressure and volume homeostasis. The phenomena of atrial stretch or distension, which triggers ANP release, is often in response to excess blood volume entering the heart, providing a mechanism at the cellular level which actively regulates systemic cardiovascular balance.
Like all cardiac myocytes, atrial myocytes are embedded in a dense network of connective tissue that provides structural support. These cells are characterized by a single, centrally located nucleus, and overall, have a rod-like appearance with branching ends that connect with adjacent cells to form a continuous, synchronized ensemble. Their cytoplasm is abundant with mitochondria, reflecting the high energy demand associated with constant contraction and relaxation. At the ultrastructural level, atrial myocytes display striations due to the regular arrangement of actin and myosin proteins, which facilitate the contraction process essential for the heart's pump function.

This specific location assigns endosteal cells critical roles in the bone maintenance and regeneration process as they actively participate in bone remodeling, a process that involves both the formation and resorption of bone tissue.
Endosteal cells function by regulating the activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are cells that deposit new bone, and osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption, a process important for the maintenance, repair, and remodelling of bones. When new bone tissue is required, such as in instances of bone fractures or increased mechanical stress, endosteal cells differentiate into osteoblasts to facilitate the bone formation process. Conversely, when bone resorption is necessary, these cells are known to release signals that lead to the recruitment and activation of osteoclasts.
In addition to this, endosteal cells play a significant role in hematopoiesis, which is the formation of blood cellular components. They function in this process by providing a niche for hematopoietic stem cells, serving to support their maintenance and differentiation. Understanding the functionality of endosteal cells is important in the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy, especially in diseases affecting bone remodeling and hematopoiesis.

Many of these receptors are responsive to luminal content, which makes brush cells vital for regulating and coordinating appropriate physiological responses to changes in these substances. 
Recent research has also elucidated an important role for these cells in immunity. Intestinal brush cells have been found to be the source of a cytokine called interleukin-25, which can initiate type 2 immune responses during parasitic infections. This immune function, along with the chemosensing abilities, signifies that brush cells could serve crucial roles in health and disease, although much research is still required to fully elucidate their myriad roles in physiology and pathology.

They are situated in the anterior portion of the lens, precisely in the lens capsule, and stretch over the lens' frontal surface.
The primary function of anterior lens cells is to facilitate eye accommodation by controlling the shape and thickness of the eye lens.
The cells are involved in continuous proliferation, migration, and differentiation into lens fiber cells, helping to maintain lens growth and transparency. Anterior lens cells have a prolonged life span and reveal an extraordinary ability to function indefinitely, a characteristic that is critical for maintaining lens transparency. Damage or disturbance to the anterior lens cells can give rise to lens opacity, eventually leading to cataracts, which is a common cause of vision loss.

They play an essential role in vision by enabling light transmission and focus on the retina, which allows for clear, distinct vision. These cells are characterized by their lack of nuclei and organelles, their orderly alignment, and their high protein content, particularly crystallins. 
Lens fibers are differentiated from equatorial epithelial cells of the lens in a process that involves cell elongation, denucleation and tight packing, which serve to reduce light scattering occurrences in the eye. This differentiation accelerates substantially after birth in comparison to during embryogenesis and continues throughout life, contributing to the growth of the eye lens. Secondary lens fibers are specifically those cells that are newly differentiated and cover the old lens fiber core. This process also leads to the removal of light-obstructing cellular components, mainly nuclei and organelles, making these fibers transparent and ideal for their function. 
The fibers carry out their primary function of light refraction via a high concentration of specialized proteins known as crystallins, which form a gradient of refractive index together with the cytoplasm. This index manipulation facilitates precise light focus onto the retina. Secondary lens fibers also contribute to the lens's shape and biomechanical properties through intercellular interactions, particularly at the sutures where the ends of the fibers meet. Any disruption to secondary lens fibers can lead to vision problems, including cataracts, which is the clouding of the lens resulting from the aggregation of crystallin proteins.

Situated at the bottom of the minute pockets known as crypts of Lieberkühn, these are undifferentiated cells that have the ability to perpetually self-renew, as well as differentiate into various other cell types that constitute the epithelial lining of the intestine. 
The fundamental role of intestinal crypt stem cells is to provide a constant supply of new cells to maintain the cellular turnover of the intestinal epithelium, a tissue known for rapid self-renewal. These stem cells are nurtured and protected by specialized epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and together constitute the intestinal stem cell niche. 
An important function of intestinal crypt stem cells is to sustain the balance between cell division and programmed cell death, called apoptosis, to ensure the integrity of the intestinal lining. Given their active proliferation rate, these stem cells initiate the creation of diverse differentiated cell types, including enterocytes (the primary absorptive cells in the intestinal lumen), goblet cells (that produce mucus to protect the epithelial layer), enteroendocrine cells (involved in producing gastrointestinal hormones), and Paneth cells (involved in secreting antimicrobial peptides). This diversity in output regulates the physiological activities of the gut ranging from nutrient absorption, hormone secretion, bacterial balance, to immunity.
Research studies suggest that dysregulation in intestinal crypt stem cell proliferation and differentiation is associated with several intestinal disorders including intestinal cancer, and various enteropathies.

These cells form the innermost monolayer of the sinusoidal blood vessels, also known as sinusoids, that mediate the exchange of nutrients, metabolites, and waste materials between the blood and the surrounding organ tissue. SECs possess distinctive morphological features including a large, flattened shape, an abundance of fenestrations or pores, and the lack of a continuous basement membrane. These structural characteristics distinguish sinusoidal endothelial cells from other, more regularly structured endothelial cells in the body.
Due to their special fenestrated structure, SECs facilitate the exchange of macromolecules, like lipoproteins and hyaluronan, between plasma and the surrounding organ parenchymal cells. These fenestrations act like sieves, allowing the passage of substances based on their size and charge. It's noteworthy that the permeability characteristics of SECs can be regulated dynamically according to the body's homeostatic needs. 
Beyond their key role in exchange mechanisms, endothelial cells of sinusoids are involved in several other functions. In the liver, for example, they help in the removal and endocytic degradation of waste macromolecules, immune response, and regulation of liver regeneration. They also participate in the formation and remodeling of blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Additionally, in recent years, it has been discovered that these cells may have a role in disease conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer.

PP cells are one of the rarer pancreatic cell types and are more prevalent in the head and neck of the pancreas. They are critical in normal pancreatic physiological functions and are involved in the development of pancreatic endocrine disorders.
The primary function of PP cells is the production and secretion of the pancreatic polypeptide hormone (PP). This hormone plays a crucial role in several gastrointestinal functions and metabolic responses. The release of the PP hormone is stimulated after eating, especially in protein-rich meals, leading to it being present in large amounts during digestion. The fundamental role of PP is to self-regulate pancreatic secretion activities ensuring its exocrine and endocrine functions are under control.
The pancreatic polypeptide hormone from PP cells also aids in adapting to low physical activity and fasting by reducing the production of insulin and glucagon and inhibiting the hepatic glucose production. Additionally, this hormone influences gut motility by slowing down the gastric emptying and reducing small intestinal transit, thereby controlling the pace at which nutritional substances are absorbed. Because of these functions, any malfunction or irregularity in PP cells can result in various disorders such as diabetes and pancreatic diseases.

Together, the pigmented and non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells form a bilayer epithelium that allows the secretion of aqueous humor through a bi-directional fluid transport mechanism.
Pigmented ciliary epithelial cells also contribute to the blood-aqueous barrier, a physiological frontier that controls the entry and exit of various substances from the blood to the aqueous humor and vice versa. The pigmentation in these cells, intensified by melanin, helps to absorb scattered light coming into the eye, reducing any potential damage and glare.

They are keratin-5-positive, nonciliated, cuboidal cells and typically tightly attached to the basement membrane. In humans, the proportion of basal cells in the respiratory epithelium gradually decreases going down the tracheobronchial tree: they represent approximately 34% of the cells in the trachea, 27% in the large airways, and 10% in the small airways, although it is worth noting that there are differences in the compositions of the tracheobronchial epithelia between different species.
Basal epithelial cells serve as the basal layer of the tracheobronchial epithelium, providing both structural and regenerative support for the epithelial tissue that lines the upper regions of the respiratory tract. They serve as progenitor or stem cells that are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types, such as ciliated and secretory cells. This gives them a central role in homeostatic maintenance of the epithelium, and in repairing damaged epithelium after an injury or during disease. This regenerative capacity is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the tracheobronchial surface, especially given its continual exposure to inhaled irritants and microorganisms. 
In addition to their primary restorative function, basal epithelial cells are also involved in the initial immune response within the tracheobronchial tree. Equipped with pattern recognition receptors, these cells can identify and respond to pathogenic organisms, triggering an immune response and producing a range of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, to help combat infections.

The primary function of mTECs revolves around negative selection of developing T cells, thus preventing autoimmune responses. mTECs allow developing T cells to recognize and be responsive to foreign antigens while remaining tolerant to the body's own tissues. They achieve this through a process called promiscuous gene expression where they express and display a vast array of self-antigens. This process is regulated by a transcriptional regulator called autoimmune regulator (Aire), which contributes to immunological self-tolerance.
mTECs themselves have a self-renewing ability and sustain the continuous export of mature T cells. They also express a number of genes that encode for chemokines and other signaling molecules which draw in and retain developing T cells for the process of negative selection. The three-dimensional network formed by these cells provides a physical platform for such selection.

Named because their shape resembles a goblet - a drinking vessel with a wide body and narrow neck - these cells form a vital part of the respiratory system's protective mechanisms. They are found within the columnar epithelium lining these organs, which forms a barrier between the internal body and the exterior environment.
A principal function of the respiratory goblet cell is the production and secretion of mucus, a carbohydrate-rich, viscous and gel-like substance that plays a critical role in trapping dust, bacteria, viruses, and other airborne particles that are inhaled. The mucus secreted by the goblet cells covers the lining of the respiratory tract, effectively catching these particles and preventing them from reaching the lungs and causing infection. Mucus also provides hydration and lubrication to the respiratory tract surfaces, which is important in maintaining the tissue's health and functioning.
In addition to their mucus-secreting capabilities, respiratory goblet cells also play a significant role in the body's inflammatory responses. When the respiratory system is exposed to irritants or pathogens, the number and activity of goblet cells often increase, leading to a higher production of mucus. This is a protective response designed to trap and neutralize the harmful substances more effectively. However, in conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, an overproliferation of goblet cells, also known as goblet cell hyperplasia, can lead to excessive mucus production and airway obstruction.

The primary function of somatic cells is to maintain the function and survival of an organism. They carry significant information in the form of DNA, and through the process of mitosis, contribute to the repair and regeneration of body tissues.
Further, some types of somatic cells work in a collaborative manner to form complex functional structures such as the skin and lining of the gut, demonstrating a higher level of organization. However, it's important to note that somatic cells are distinct from germ cells, which are responsible for sexual reproduction by forming sperm or eggs. Any alterations in the DNA of somatic cells, due to mutations, will not affect the offspring as they aren't involved in transmission of genetic information to the next generation. 
While most somatic cells contain two copies of each chromosome (diploid), a certain subset may possess a single set of chromosomes (haploid), specifically found in male ants, bees, and other hymenopterans. Hence, diversity is a defining characteristic of somatic cells, reflecting in their structures, roles, and genetic makeup.

Smooth muscle cells in the enteric system possess unique attributes that distinguish them from other smooth muscle cells in the body. One crucial function is peristalsis, where these cells contract in a coordinated manner, generating a wave of contraction and relaxation. This peristaltic movement facilitates the movement of food particles through the digestive tract, playing a vital role in the digestion and absorption processes in animals. Additionally, these cells are responsible for maintaining the tone of gastrointestinal sphincters, controlling passage and preventing one-sided movement of the contents.
Enteric smooth muscle cells are also involved in local immune responses of the gastrointestinal tract. They can communicate with local immune cells and secrete cytokines or other signaling molecules in response to infectious organisms, which makes them crucial mediocellular players in gastrointestinal homeostasis and response to disease. Their interactions with other cell types, such as neurons, myofibroblasts, and interstitial cells of Cajal, further contribute to these cells' role in maintaining the physiological functions of the gastrointestinal system.

These specific cholangiocytes arise from bipotent hepatoblasts, whereas extrahepatic cholangiocytes share an embryologic origin with the ventral pancreas.
Recent research suggests that there is also heterogeneity within populations of intrahepatic cholangiocytes with different transcriptional profiles, proliferative capacity, and biological function; for example, subpopulations differ in calcium-mobilizing receptors.
The primary function of intrahepatic cholangiocytes is related to bile formation and maintenance of its flow. In addition to their secretory and absorptive activities, they are involved in the regulation of bile composition, volume, and alkalinization, contributing to the neutralization of the acidic chyme (partly digested food) that enters the intestine from the stomach. Intrahepatic cholangiocytes are also recognized for their role in liver regeneration and repair, often proliferating in response to injury. 
Intrahepatic cholangiocytes take part in certain pathological conditions, like primary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. Changes in these cells often lead to abnormalities in bile formation and transport, causing cholestatic liver diseases.

The contractile phenotype is characterized by high contractility and low proliferation rate, while the synthetic phenotype is marked by increased cell proliferation and matrix synthesis but reduced contractile function.
Aortic smooth muscle cells have a significant role in the physiological and pathological processes of the cardiovascular system. In the normal physiological state, they contribute to the elasticity and flexibility of the aorta. Conversely, in pathological states, changes in the function and structure of aortic smooth muscle cells are connected with various vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and aneurysm.

Myelin serves as an insulator and enhances the speed and efficiency of electrical nerve impulses; a single Schwann cell can myelinate a single axon. Myelination starts by the elongation and envelopment of the Schwann cell around the axon, followed by the synthesis and deposition of myelin layers. Some studies suggest that Schwann cells may regulate neuronal action potential, muscular contraction, and the sensitive response. 
While Schwann cells are most commonly known for the formation of the myelin sheath, some Schwann cells do not form myelin: Remak Schwann cells, a class of nonmyelinating Schwann cells, ensheath axons with smaller diameter, such as C fiber nociceptors in sciatic nerves and form Remak bundles.
Schwann cells are found along both motor and sensory neurons and are crucial for the advancement and recovery of peripheral nerve injuries, due to their capacity to support nerve regeneration. In cases of nerve injury, Schwann cells play a vital role in recovery by initiating Wallerian degeneration, a process in which the part of the axon distal to the injury site degrades and is then cleared away. Following this, Schwann cells can guide the regrowth of the nerve, providing a conducive environment for axon regeneration. They remodel themselves into a regenerative phenotype, proliferate, and organize themselves into bands of Büngner that provide physical and chemical guidance for the regrowths of axons.

The pigmentation of RPE cells actively aids in the absorption of excess light and the prevention of light scattering, thus enhancing the eye's optical properties.
The retinal pigment epithelium forms a key part of the blood/retina barrier. The cells have long sheet-like microvilli on their apical membrane that project into the light-sensitive outer segments of the photoreceptors, forming a close structural interaction. The basolateral membrane of the RPE interacts with the underlying Bruch’s membrane, which separates the RPE cells from fenestrated endothelium of the choriocapillaris. 
RPE cells support the photoreceptor by providing them with oxygen and nutrients (such as glucose, retinol and fatty acids) and removing waste products. They also recycle the visual pigment, in a process called the \"visual cycle\", where the RPE cells play a vital role in the regeneration of visual pigment (11-cis retinol) following the absorption of light. This is essential for the maintenance of photoreceptor excitability.
Beyond this, RPE cells take part in the phagocytosis process, where they digest the shed ends of photoreceptor outer segments, thus, preventing the build-up of waste residue that could otherwise harm retinal health.

These cells also exhibit altered contractile behavior and an augmented immune response during inflammatory lung diseases.

The smooth appearance is due to the organization of actin and myosin filaments in the cell, which allows for a controlled, contractile function.
These cells play a key role in controlling the diameter of the trachea, thus regulating the airflow. They are responsible for the involuntary constriction and relaxation of the trachea influencing the air passage during various physiological behaviors like breathing, coughing, and sneezing. This autonomic control allows for adaptations to specific body requirements without conscious control, such as increasing air flow during exercise or restricting it during rest.
In conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, there are changes in smooth muscle cells. For example, the mass of smooth muscle cells increases in chronic airway diseases, possibly in response to chronic inflammation. This increase may indicate a pathological condition or be a part of the body's response to injury and repair.

In the non-pregnant uterus, they exist in a quiescent phase. Upon implantation, these cells are primarily responsible for the expansion consequently allowing the uterus to accommodate the growing fetus. Towards the end of pregnancy, under the influence of hormonal and mechanical signals, uterine smooth muscle cells transition from a relaxed phase to an active contractile phase, culminating in the delivery of the fetus.
At the cellular level, these transitions involve significant changes in the electrophysiological properties of uterine smooth muscle cells. Governed by a complex interplay of ion channels, transporters, and signaling proteins, these cells adjust their electrical activity, conduction properties, and contracting mechanisms. Any issues with these processes can result in problems such as preterm birth or labor dysfunction.

Because human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) can easily be derived from the umbilical cord, and because they express common endothelial cell markers, they have been used as an epithelial cell model for studies on cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and inflammation.

In response to pathogens and injuries, microglial cells mature and change their morphology from a ramified shape with small processes (normal state) to an amoeboid shape (mature state).
Mature microglial cells possess multiple functional abilities, thereby enabling them to execute diverse roles in order to maintain the health of surrounding neural cells. They act to clear away cellular debris, dead neurons, or plaque formations through the process of phagocytosis. They are also continuously scanning their environment and are able to detect subtle changes in the neural landscape caused by injury, disease, or infection. Upon detection of such changes, these cells become activated and present antigens and secrete cytokines and chemokines to initiate an inflammation response, which sustains the brain’s defense against injurious agents.
Their role is not solely destructive or defensive: mature microglial cells also contribute to neurodevelopment by guiding the formation of neural circuits, synaptogenesis, and remodeling. Furthermore, they assist in managing synaptic plasticity, a key process in learning and memory functions. While the dysregulation of microglial cells has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, they are also regarded as potential therapeutic targets for such conditions, given their crucial roles in maintaining CNS health.

Vascular sprouting relies on the coordinated activity of migrating endothelial tip cells at the forefront and proliferating stalk cells that elongate the sprout. The process is tightly controlled by different growths factors: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor acts on endothelial cells, inducing them to become endothelial tip cells that initiate sprouting. After sprouting initiation, activation of Notch signaling suppresses differentiation toward a tip cell phenotype and some of the endothelial cells differentiate into stalk cells, which follow tip cells, multiply, and elongate to provide a structural backbone to the growing vessel sprout. 
In contrast to endothelial tip cells, which migrate and lead the angiogenic sprout, endothelial stalk cells behind the sprouts continue forming the tube or lumen for blood flow and facilitate maturation and stability of the new vessel. The delicate balance between the activities of stalk and tip cells during angiogenesis is crucial to build a functional vascular network. Dysfunctions in endothelial stalk cells can lead to pathological conditions such as impaired wound healing, unregulated tumor growth, and metastasis due to abnormal angiogenesis.

These cells work by selectively absorbing specific ions from the environment, thus maintaining the body's internal ionic balance. The most commonly absorbed ions include sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca2+), and hydrogen (H+). Moreover, ionocytes contribute to acid-base regulation. In response to acidosis or alkalosis, ionocytes can either excrete or retain hydrogen (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions to readjust the blood pH. Further, experimental evidence suggests a functional complexity of ionocytes, implying diverse roles beyond ion regulation. Recent research highlights ionocytes' involvement in ammonia excretion and the regulation of extracellular fluid volume, highlighting their contribution to the overall homeostatic process.

A key function of renal principal cells is the regulation of water balance in the body. These cells express aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels, which facilitate the reabsorption of water from the fluid within the renal tubule lumen back into the blood. The translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane is controlled by the hormone vasopressin: In response to high vasopressin levels, AQP2 moves to the cell membrane, allowing water to pass through effectively and be reabsorbed, therefore concentrating the urine. Conversely, in low vasopressin conditions, AQP2 is removed from the membrane, reducing water reabsorption and diluting the urine. 
Renal principal cells are also involved in the regulation of sodium and potassium levels in the body. They have sodium channels (ENaC) in their luminal membranes which permit the reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubule fluid back into the blood, resulting in a net reabsorption of sodium ions into the systemic circulation. This process is controlled, in part, by the hormone aldosterone. Additionally, renal principal cells contain potassium channels that facilitate the secretion of potassium ions into the urine.

Alpha intercalated cells are more predominant when the body is in a state of acidosis, a condition characterized by an increased acidity of the blood. These cells are specialized in secreting excessive hydrogen ions into the urine through a mechanism involving vacuolar H+-ATPase and H+/K+-ATPase pumps on their apical membranes. They simultaneously reabsorb bicarbonate ions from the tubular fluid and return them to the bloodstream via mechanisms involving carbonic anhydrase II and bicarbonate/chloride exchangers on the basolateral membrane. This dual process helps to increase blood pH towards normal levels.

These clusters of cells constitute only about 1% of the pancreatic islet cell population, making them a relatively small yet significant component of the pancreas.  Pancreatic epsilon cells have a round or ovoid shape with occasional cytoplasmic extensions and are characterized by small and spherical granules. 
The principal function of pancreatic epsilon cells involves the synthesis and release of the hormone ghrelin, a peptide hormone predominantly produced in the stomach; pancreatic epsilon cells are one of the few sites outside the gastrointestinal tract known to produce this hormone. Ghrelin has multiple vital roles, playing a significant part in generating hunger sensations, promoting fat storage, and influencing various metabolic processes. It also stimulates the release of Growth Hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland.
During fetal development, when they form a layer around the islet, epsilon cells are an important source of ghrelin, likely secreting the hormone into the circulation; their numbers decrease in adults. While research on pancreatic epsilon cells is still ongoing, these cells have been implicated in several disease states, most notably Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The dysfunction or reduction in the number of pancreatic epsilon cells can lead to anomalies in ghrelin production, impacting overall metabolic homeostasis and glucose regulation.

They first arise from the endoderm, one of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo, and then differentiate into two distinct mature liver cell types - the hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. 
During liver organogenesis hepatoblasts proliferate and migrate into the septum transversum to form the liver bud. Proliferation and differentiation of these cells are regulated by several soluble factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor, which is a mitogen of both hepatoblasts and mature hepatocytes. As they start to differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, the cells begin to express hepatic markers like albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. 
Although hepatoblasts are specified embryonic liver cells that are bipotential for hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, a subset of liver cells (called oval cells) has been identified in adults that express stem cell markers, such as CD133 and cKIT, and has been suggested to have the same potential as hepatoblasts to differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

They are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and are an intermediate stage marking the transition from an osteoprogenitor cell to a fully differentiated osteoblast. The presence of preosteoblasts signifies the site of new bone deposition, highlighting their crucial role in skeletal development and in response to bone injury repairs.
The primary function of preosteoblasts is to differentiate into osteoblasts, which are responsible for secreting osteoid (the unmineralized portion of bone matrix) and regulating the process of bone mineralization. Preosteoblasts are regulated by various growth factors and hormones, including bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Vitamin D.
However, the function of preosteoblasts is not limited to bone formation alone. In addition to osteogenesis, preosteoblasts significantly contribute to the maintenance of bone homeostasis through regulating the activity of osteoclasts - the cells responsible for bone resorption. This regulation is mediated through RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway signaling. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) released from the preosteoblasts acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL impairing osteoclast formation, hence preventing excessive bone resorption. This regulatory role indicates the dual functionality of preosteoblasts, which are indispensable for both the formation of new bone and the maintenance of existing bone tissue.

Functionally, enteroendocrine cells play a pivotal role in the gut-endocrine system, which is responsible for the digestive process. These cells translate the luminal nutrient status into hormonal signals thereby acting as chemosensors. They contain secretory granules at their base which release hormones into the bloodstream following chemo-sensation. The hormones they secrete perform diverse functions including regulating gastric secretion, gut motility, insulin release, appetite control and other local and systemic effects. 
In addition to their endocrine functions, enteroendocrine cells also play a part in the modulation of the immune response in the gut. They can secrete cytokines and chemokines that have a role in directing the immune response to invading pathogens. Moreover, emerging research suggests that these cells play a role in maintaining the balance between gut resident bacteria, known as the gut microbiota, and the host.

Under disease conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, Paneth cells increase in numbers in the colon. They reside in the crypts of Lieberkühn, which are glandular structures embedded within the mucosal layer of the small and large intestine. 
Paneth cells play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and acting as a frontline of defense in our bodies against ingested microbes. They achieve this through the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and proteins such as lysozyme and defensins, which can directly kill or inhibit the growth of various bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They degranulate these substances into the intestinal lumen, especially under conditions of pathogenic invasion or damage to the epithelial lining. 
Moreover, Paneth cells are essential for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells, which continually replace the epithelium of the intestine. They create a niche for these stem cells at the base of the crypts, secreting various signaling molecules and factors that are essential for the growth and differentiation of intestinal stem cells. In essence, the existence and function of Paneth cells are fundamental to the overall gut health and immune defense system, by providing both antimicrobial functions and a conducive environment for the renewal of the intestinal lining. 
The role of Paneth cells specifically in the colon is of interest in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease: Their presence in the colon is thought to represent Paneth cell metaplasia and indicates a chronic inflammatory state.

The small intestine's efficiency in absorbing nutrients, its protective barrier function, and its innate cellular renewal every few days is largely dependent on the role played by these TACs.
TACs of the small intestine are primarily present in the crypt-villus structure of the intestine, more specifically in the crypt region. They originate from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells that reside at the base of the crypts. Following their derivation from stem cells, TACs undergo up to six rounds of rapid division over a 48-72 hour period, effectively amplifying the cell population, hence their name. During this process, they gradually migrate upward along the walls of the crypt from where they differentiate into diverse mature cell types such as enterocytes, goblet cells, and Paneth cells. 
TACs serve as an important element in the homeostasis and regeneration of the intestinal epithelium, amplifying the pool of cells available for differentiation. They also minimize genetic errors during DNA replication by serving as a 'buffer zone' between the long-lived stem cells and the terminal differentiated cells of the gut lining, thus reducing the potential for propagation of mutation-causing defects. Lastly, TACs play an essential part in gastrointestinal tissue repair following injury or inflammation. Their rapid proliferation and subsequent differentiation abilities often help expedite the wound healing process in the intestinal epithelium.

They possess self-renewal ability, an essential feature of stem cells, which allows them to maintain a steady population in the small intestine.
One of the critical roles of intestinal crypt stem cells is to drive the continual renewal process taking place in the small intestine every 3-5 days.

Intestinal macrophages represent the largest group of macrophages in the body and play a key role as sentinels for pathogen recognition and elimination. Because the gastrointestinal tract is continually exposed to a high antigenic load derived from microbes and food intake, macrophages in the intestines are crucial not only for the gut’s immune defense but also for maintaining gastrointestinal homeostasis, avoiding chronic inflammation despite constantly facing foreign antigens. The phenotypic profiles and cytokine production of intestinal macrophages therefore differ from conventional macrophages elsewhere in the body. 
Colon macrophages orchestrate a wide variety of immune responses. They interact with the colon’s microflora thanks to their location in the mucosal layer, thus playing an important role in shaping gut immunity. By presenting antigens, they help to activate and steer an appropriate immune response either by triggering inflammation against harmful pathogens or by supporting tolerance for beneficial microbes. Therefore, disturbances in the colon macrophage population is thought to contribute to colon-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. 
These immune cells are versatile and multifunctional, not just limited to defensive actions. Colon macrophages interact with the enteric nervous system to regulate gut secretion and motility. They also play a crucial role in maintaining colon tissue health and integrity by contributing to tissue repair processes. This occurs either through phagocytosis of dead cells and remnants, or indirectly through the release of growth factor molecules, which stimulate cellular proliferation and differentiation necessary for tissue regeneration.

The primary function of goblet cells is the secretion of mucus, which is an essential substance for the protection and successful functioning of the intestinal tract. In the colon, goblet cells continuously renew the inner mucus layer, which is attached and impervious to bacteria (the outer layer of the colon is unattached and is the habitat of commensal bacteria)
The mucus secreted by goblet cells is rich in glycoproteins known as mucins, especially MUC2, forming a complex web of molecules that comprises the foundational structure of the mucus layer. It traps and eliminates harmful bacteria, while selectively allowing beneficial microbiota to access the epithelial surface and aid in digestion and nutrient absorption. The mucus layer not only provides a provides a protective barrier against pathogen invasion, as well as mechanical damage, and the erosive effects of digestive enzymes, it also acts as a lubricant to facilitate the passage of food material.
Colon goblet cells are also involved in regulating the local immune response within the gut, maintaining the delicate balance between necessary immune reactions to harmful pathogens and tolerance to beneficial microbiota and dietary substances. Goblet cells can modulate immune responses by presenting antigens to dendritic cells, as well as through the production of immunomodulatory molecules that can alter the behavior of immune cells. When the inner mucus layer of the colon is defective, it might be a pathophysiological mechanism for colitis and infectious diseases.

Tuft cells in the colon primarily function as chemosensory cells that can sense and respond to environmental changes. These cells can detect and respond to microbial metabolites, helping initiate immune responses against potential threats. 
Recent studies have revealed that tuft cells play a role in responding to intestinal parasitic infections. When a gastrointestinal parasite infects the colon, tuft cells are activated and release the cytokine IL-25. This action increases the production of tuft cells and triggers essential Th2 immune responses to expel the parasites. Also, the removal of tuft cells has been linked to increased susceptibility to these infections.

This fluid environment, maintained by these endothelial cells, provides a platform for the material exchange between blood and tissues, thereby modulating blood coagulation, immune responses, and controlling vasodilation and vasoconstriction. 
Functionally, the endothelial cells of the uterus are paramount in regulating the uterine blood flow, an important determinant of successful conception and pregnancy outcomes. They support the vascular changes during the reproductive cycle, particularly the spiral arteriolar development and function, essential in endometrial thickening, maturation, and eventual shedding during menstruation periods. The cells also contribute to angiogenesis, a process crucial during implantation and placenta development, whereby new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels to supply the growing fetus with oxygen and nutrients. Uterine endothelial cells are also implicated in mediating immune responses within the uterus. Changes in these cells can influence various conditions such as reproductive disorders and complications including heavy menstrual bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, fertility problems, and cancer.

The entire life cycle of a lens fiber cell includes differentiation from lens epithelial cells, which are the progenitor cells lying at the anterior surface of the lens. In response to various signals, these cells elongate and migrate towards the posterior pole, while simultaneously undergoing a process of denucleation and degradation of cellular organelles. This unique process ensures that the cells do not scatter light, which is critical for the transparency of the lens. After reaching full maturity, lens fiber cells form tightly packed layers, known as laminae, to make up the distinctive architecture of the ocular lens. 
Lens fiber cells play pivotal roles in vision. Their primary function is to transmit and focus the light that enters the eye onto the retina, providing the sharpness and clarity necessary for vision. The precise alignment and organization of these cells allow for optimal light transmittance and minimizes scattering, thereby maintaining the transparency of the lens.

These cells are pivotal in embryogenesis, fetal nutrition, waste removal, and immune response generation, contributing crucially to the success of pregnancy.
Chorionic trophoblast cells undergo trophoblast differentiation, giving rise to specialized sub-types: cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Cytotrophoblasts, found in the inner layer, serve as stem cells and contribute to proliferative activities. In contrast, syncytiotrophoblasts, originating from cytotrophoblasts, form the outer layer with a distinctive multinucleated, continuous, and non-proliferative structure.

Apart from their physiological roles, chorionic trophoblast cells play a crucial role in shielding the fetus from the maternal immune system. They accomplish this by modifying the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which are self-identifying proteins utilized by the immune system to identify foreign cells. Through selective expression of specific types of these molecules, trophoblast cells can evade cytotoxic T cells that might otherwise attack them, while still retaining the ability to attract natural killer cells. These natural killer cells assist in trophoblast invasion and the remodeling of blood vessels in the uterus.

The main responsibility of the pulmonary ionocyte pertains to the regulation and mobilization of chloride ions. They express a high level of CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene, which encodes a protein channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes. The activity of CFTR regulates the movement of chloride ions and fluids in and out of cells, which helps maintain a balance of fluid in the organs they are expressed in. If CFTR is dysfunctional, it can cause conditions such as cystic fibrosis, characterized by thick, sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and obstruct the pancreas, leading to respiratory and digestive issues.

Moreover, the smooth muscle fibers enhance the ileum's ability to expand and adapt to volume changes without elevating internal pressure, known as compliance.
The smooth muscle fiber of the ileum contributes to reflex responses, enhancing muscle contractions to propel intestinal contents in different physiological conditions. This involves intricate molecular signaling with neurotransmitters, hormones, and local signals. Thus, beyond its structural role, the smooth muscle fiber is crucial for the physiological functions of digestion and absorption in the small intestine.

The type of epithelial cells found in the urethra can vary along its length. In general, the urethra is lined with stratified squamous epithelium in its distal or external portion, which is closer to the external environment. This type of epithelium provides protection against mechanical stress and pathogens. Closer to the bladder, the urethra transitions to a different type of epithelium. In males, the proximal part of the urethra is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium in the region where it passes through the prostate gland. In females, the transitional epithelium may be present in the proximal part of the urethra near the bladder.
Epithelial cells of the urethra are primarily dedicated to the protection of underlying tissues from mechanical stress and pathogens during micturition (urination). They do this by creating a tight, impermeable barrier that prevents the entry and colonization of invading microbes. They produce a variety of antimicrobials and are tightly packed to prevent infiltration between cells, forming an integral part of the body's innate immune system.
In addition to their protective role, these cells are involved in the secretion of mucus. This mucus acts as a lubricant that ensures the smooth and easy passage of urine from the bladder through the urethra and out of the body, reducing any potential damage from the erosive action of urine. Epithelial cells of the urethra are dynamic, constantly renewing their numbers to replace any cells lost through wear and tear. Any disruptions to the function or integrity of these cells may contribute to urinary tract infections and other urological disorders.

The mucus secreted by bronchial goblet cells serves as a protective layer over the delicate and sensitive structures of the bronchi. The mucus, an amalgamation of glycoproteins, lipids, and other substances, traps any inhaled dust, microorganisms, and pollutants, preventing them from reaching deeper lung tissues and causing potential damage. Additionally, the mucus secretion aids in moistening the airway surface, thereby facilitating effective gas exchange and maintaining the overall health of the respiratory tract.
Bronchial goblet cells have an innate defense mechanism wherein they increase secretion of mucus in response to irritants, infection or inflammation in the airway. This strategy, however, if incessantly stimulated, can lead to airway obstruction and health complications like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The key function of goblet cells is the production and secretion of a protective layer of mucus which is essential for maintaining gut homeostasis. Goblet cells have a characteristic 'goblet-like' shape, which adapts them for this specific function: organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, ER, and Golgi apparatus are located in the basal portion of the cell; while the vesicles with mucins (required for mucus production) are located apically, close to the apical membrane where their exocytosis takes place.
The goblet cells of the large intestine produce a thick layer of mucus that coats the intestinal lumen. This mucus provides a barrier that prevents the direct contact of intestinal cells with bacteria and other potentially toxic substances present in the digestive tract. It also lubricates the intestine to facilitate the smooth passage of digested food material. It is worth noting that the mucus system differs between the small and large intestine: although in both the mucus is built around MUC2 mucin polymers produced by goblet cells, it is becoming clear that there are several types of goblet cells that function in different ways. 
From an immunological perspective, large intestine goblet cells participate in promoting a balanced gut immune response. They contribute to the process known as immune tolerance, where they prevent the body's immune system from overreacting to the trillions of bacteria present in the gut. These cells achieve this by secreting molecules that help maintain a calm environment, limiting inflammatory reactions unless absolutely necessary. Any dysfunction or decrease in the number of goblet cells can result in a compromised intestinal barrier leading to various health issues, including inflammatory bowel disease.

Like all intestinal goblet cells, the primary function of ileal goblet cells is the production and secretion of mucins, large, heavily glycosylated proteins that combine to form mucus. This mucus lining serves as a protective barrier, shielding the underlying tissue from the potentially damaging effects of digestive enzymes, acids, or pathogenic microbes present in the gut lumen. Their strategic location in the ileal segment of the intestinal tract aids in efficient nutrient absorption while also maintaining an impregnable barrier against potential pathogens, ensuring an intricate balance.
Goblet cells of the ileum also play a significant role in immune modulation. They are thought to promote oral tolerance (the immune unresponsiveness to orally ingested antigens such as food) by delivering luminal antigens to underlying dendritic cells, thereby driving immune education and tolerogenic responses. They also secrete bioactive molecules, such as the trefoil factor peptide TFF3, which aids in repairing damaged epithelium.

Goblet cells are filled with membrane-bound secretory granules, which are responsible for their distinctive, goblet-like shape.
Goblet cells specialize in the production and secretion of mucus, a slimy substance composed primarily of glycoproteins (mucins) and water. This sticky mucus serves to trap foreign particles and pollutants, such as dust, bacteria, and viruses that an organism breathes in. After trapping these particles, the cilia on neighboring ciliated epithelial cells beat synchronously, forming a coordinated escalator to push mucus upwards toward the pharynx, where it's either swallowed or expectorated. This system, known as the mucociliary clearance or escalator, forms a crucial barrier in the lungs against respiratory pathogens and external insults.
Changes in the number or function of tracheal goblet cells can engender health complications. For example, goblet cell hyperplasia, or excessive growth of goblet cells, is a common feature of chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This condition results in mucus hypersecretion, airway blockage, and increased risk of respiratory tract infections.

They are typically nonciliated, cuboidal cells that are tightly attached to the basement membrane, thereby providing structural support for the epithelial tissues.  
The function of the basal cell of the bronchial epithelium is multifaceted, underscoring the importance of these cells for respiratory health. One of their primary roles involves regeneration and cellular turnover. They serve as local stem cells, being able to proliferate and differentiate into other cell types such as ciliated and secretory epithelial cells. This regenerative function of basal cells is required for maintaining the integrity of the bronchial epithelium and is especially critical after injury or during disease states when there is an increased need for new cells to repair damaged tissue or replace lost cells. 
In addition to these regenerative duties, basal cells of the bronchial epithelium play a crucial role in providing a defensive barrier against inhaled substances. They participate in the coordinated immune response directed against airborne pathogens, foreign particles, and toxins that enter the respiratory tract. Basal cells can respond to inflammation or irritation by altering their activities, which include proliferating, differentiating, or producing bioactive substances. Throughout all these responses, the basal cells help to maintain the homeostasis of the bronchial tubes, allowing for the efficient transport of air to and from the lungs.

M cells play a crucial role in the immune response within the intestine environment. 
These cells are characterized by microfolds (short microvilli, which give them their name), a reduced, thin glycocalyx, and a deeply invaginated basolateral membrane next to immune cells such as B cells, T cells, and macrophages, and DCs. 
These features allow the M cells to form the first point of contact between the gut lumen and the intestinal immune system. They are well-regulated gateways that capture and transport antigens, such as bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances found in the lumen, to the underlying cells of the immune system. This specialized transport mechanism, called ‘transcytosis’, involves engulfment of these antigens from the apical side, transport across their cytoplasm, and release on the basolateral side of the cells, where immune responses can be initiated. 
Furthermore, M cells have complex interactions with members of the gut microbiota and other immune cells, making them essential for maintaining gut homeostasis. This cross-talk shapes the diversity and makeup of the gut microbiota, subsequently having a substantial impact on the host's health. In certain situations, pathogenic organisms can exploit the transcytosis mechanism to infiltrate the host's system, causing various infectious diseases.
The overarching significance of M cells in the small intestine lies in their role of surveillance and protection against a wide range of potentially harmful pathogens, while also facilitating beneficial interactions with commensal microbes.

This finely tuned environment, facilitated by HSEC, is primordial for the liver's multiple physiologic functions that include nutrient metabolism, toxin inactivation, and immunomodulation.
The HSEC have a distinctive morphology that sets them apart from the typical endothelial cells found in other organs. These cells are exceptionally thin to allow for efficient transfer of molecules and characterized by fenestrations, which are non-diaphragmatic, sieve-like openings that provide an open filtration pathway from the sinusoidal lumen to the space of Disse, where hepatocytes are exposed. The fenestration is a crucial feature that allows lipoproteins, nutrients, and other plasma components easy access to hepatocytes for essential liver functions, including clearance of waste products and metabolic regulation.
HSECs further play a vital role in immune functionality in the liver. They act as a sentinel, determining the nature of the immune response to encountered particulates. They possess a capacity for antigen presentation and express a series of immune-related surface molecules, which helps in immunosurveillance and immunoregulation. The HSEC also aid in the removal and destruction of virus-infected cells, harmful microorganisms, and circulatory waste products to safeguard liver health and general systemic cleanliness.

The primary role of these cells is to provide a barrier between the vessel wall and the blood, exhibiting selective permeability to regulate the movement of liquids, gases, and blood-borne substances across the vascular wall.
Arterial endothelial cells significantly contribute to maintaining vascular homeostasis. They are at the forefront of sensations and responses to mechanical stimuli, like shear stress and blood pressure changes. An additional key function pertains to the production of nitric oxide, which helps to regulate vascular tone and blood pressure, prevents platelet aggregation, limits leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. These varied but connected functions help to preclude the development of atherosclerosis, ensuring normal circulation and arterial health.
Moreover, these cells play a pivotal role in inflammation and coagulation processes. During inflammatory events, they express various adhesion molecules, aiding in leukocyte recruitment and rolling onto the vessel walls for immune response. They also produce anticoagulant and procoagulant substances, involved in blood clotting and clot dissolution, respectively. Dysregulation of the usual functions of arterial endothelial cells can result in serious pathophysiological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases.

These cells form a ring around the iris, the eye's colored part. Ciliary muscle cells fall into the category of smooth muscle cells, characterized by their lack of the striations typical of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Their shape is elongated and pointed at both ends, and they occur in multi-nucleated syncytia where many cells share the same cytoplasm.
Ciliary muscle cells primarily control the eye's accommodation, adjusting the thickness and curvature of the lens to fine-tune the focus of light on the retina. When ciliary muscle cells contract, tension on the zonular fibers holding the lens in place is reduced, allowing the lens to become thicker and increase its refractive power. Conversely, when the ciliary muscle cells relax, the tension on the zonular fibers increases, causing the lens to become flatter and decrease its refractive power. This adjustment facilitates clear vision at different distances, ranging from near to far objects.
Additionally, ciliary muscle cells play a role in draining the eye's aqueous humor, which is the clear fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye between the cornea and the lens. By controlling the shape of the surrounding trabecular meshwork through muscle contractions and relaxations, ciliary muscle cells indirectly regulate intraocular pressure, a factor critical for preventing ocular conditions like glaucoma.

All sections are lined with highly specialized epithelial cells adapted to perform different functions within the sections of the nephron. 
The different epithelial cells of the nephron play crucial roles in the process of filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, essential tasks for the regulation of body fluid composition and volume. During filtration, the blood is forced through the walls of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule, where waste products, electrolytes, and water are separated from the blood cells and proteins. As the filtrate then passes through the nephron, epithelial cells of the tubular portion reabsorb useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, along with most of the water back into the bloodstream. Waste products like urea and creatinine, as well as excess ions and water, remain in the tubule for elimination.
In addition, epithelial cells of the nephron also play a vital part in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by actively secreting hydrogen ions into the urine while reabsorbing bicarbonate from the urine back into the blood. They are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and contribute to erythrocyte production by releasing the hormone erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels in the blood.

Positioned adjacent to the lung tissue, these cells form a protective barrier and contribute to the structure of the visceral pleura. They are characterized by their cuboidal to squamous epithelial shape and the presence of microvilli on their surface, a feature aiding in fluid and solute exchange between the pleura and the lungs.
The primary function of mesothelial cells of visceral pleura is to secrete a lubricating serous fluid to facilitate smooth, frictionless lung movement within the thoracic cavity during respiration. This helps in the prevention of trauma or damage stemming from the constant rubbing of the lung tissue against the chest wall, hence playing a pivotal role in maintaining respiratory function. Besides fluid secretion, these cells have an essential role in the transportation of fluids and particles across the pleura, as well as in inflammation, wound healing, and tissue repair processes within the pleura.
Mesothelial cells of visceral pleura are notably implicated in the development of pleural diseases such as pleural effusion and pleural mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer primarily linked with exposure to asbestos. Alterations, such as hyperplasia or metaplasia, may occur in these mesothelial cells under pathological conditions.

Their primary role involves maintaining homeostasis and immune surveillance in the kidney microenvironment, defending against ascending urinary infections. Beyond traditional macrophage roles such as phagocytosis and antigen presentation, kidney resident macrophages also contribute significantly to the response to kidney injury including tissue repair and angiogenesis.
Under normal physiological conditions, kidney resident macrophages work to maintain the balance of the kidney's microenvironment by removing dead cells, pathogens and cellular debris, to limit inflammation and tissue damage. They are ‘professional’ phagocytes, clearing pathogens and debris by engulfing and digesting these harmful materials. Moreover, they are capable of presenting antigens to other immune cells, which aids in the activation of the adaptive immune response. 
Kidney resident macrophages show a high degree of plasticity: in response to environmental stimuli they change their morphology and cell surface markers. For example, in response to acute injury, some macrophages adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype and augment tissue damage; once the injury stimulus is removed, they may change to mediate tissue repair. 
While kidney macrophages contribute to wound healing, tissue repair and regeneration by producing key growth factors and cytokines that stimulate cell proliferation, collagen production, and blood vessel formation, dysregulation in their activity can also lead to progressive inflammation and fibrosis, common features in chronic kidney disease.

One of the principal functions of connecting tubule epithelial cells involves the selective reabsorption and secretion of various solutes. This reabsorption process includes critical regulatory electrolytes such as sodium ions (Na+), chloride ions (Cl-), and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus playing a role in the regulation of the acid-base homeostasis. Their function also involves the secretion of potassium ions (K+) into the renal tubular fluid.
The connecting tubule epithelial cells are primarily intercalated cells, which can be categorized into two types according to their specific functions: type A intercalated cells, which secrete acid, and the type B intercalated cells, which secrete base (bicarbonate) and reabsorb chloride. By regulating the concentrations of these ions, as well as reabsorption of water, connecting tubule epithelial cells contribute substantively to maintaining the body's electrolyte levels, pH balance, and overall homeostasis.
In addition to intercalating cells, the collecting duct system also has principal cells, which are characterized by the expression of the water channel AQP2. AQP2-expressing cells have also been identified in connecting tubules, but there is some controversy whether these represent a unique cell type as there are some morphologic differences compared with principal cells.

The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also plays a significant role in acid-base homeostasis by secreting protons (H+) into the tubular fluid and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus regulating the pH of the blood. The ability of DCT cells to adjust urine concentration plays a part in maintaining the body’s pH balance and preventing conditions like acidosis or alkalosis.

Unlike regular endothelial cells that line the vasculature, unique fenestrations (openings) characterize these cells, allowing for enhanced permeability and filtration efficacy.
Together with the glomerular basement membrane and podocytes, the glomerular endothelial cells form the  glomerular filtration barrier, which is responsible for blood filtration and therefore critical for removal of waste products, such as urea and creatinine, and excess substances, such as glucose and ions, from the bloodstream. The glomerular capillary endothelial cells' fenestrations permit the free flow of a variety of particles, barring larger, negatively charged proteins like serum albumin, enabling the formation of an ultrafiltrate. This ultrafiltrate is the primitive form of urine, which then passes through the proximal tubule for further processing and ultimately helps maintain systemic fluid and electrolyte balance.
Moreover, the glomerular capillary endothelial cells are also believed to play a crucial role in renal pathologies. Any compromise to their structural integrity or functional performance can lead to kidney diseases, including but not limited to, diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis.

Located before the glomerulus, a tiny, intricate network of capillaries within the nephron, these cells help control the expansion or contraction of the arteriole, thus regulating the pressure and flow of blood into the glomerulus.
Functionally, kidney afferent arteriole cells are largely involved in responding to changes in blood volume and systemic blood pressure. They achieve this by modulating the diameter of the afferent arteriole through a process known as autoregulation. Autoregulation involves two primary mechanisms: the myogenic response and the tubuloglomerular feedback. The myogenic response is essentially the intrinsic ability of the vascular smooth muscle to respond to pressure changes, while the tubuloglomerular feedback is the process where the macula densa cells located near the glomerulus respond to changes in fluid delivery rates in the tubules, sending signals to afferent arterioles to constrict or dilate accordingly. These cells also have significant interaction with renin-containing juxtaglomerular cells, which are located in the wall of afferent arterioles. Juxtaglomerular cells secrete the enzyme renin in response to low blood pressure or sympathetic nerve activity, initiating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system cascade that ultimately helps retain sodium and water to increase blood volume and pressure.

Cells associated with the efferent arteriole also respond to several systemic influences. Through complex intracellular signaling pathways, they respond to fluctuations in hormones (like angiotensin II and endothelin) and several other mediators such as nitric oxide and prostaglandins.

The primary responsibilities of the kidney efferent arteriole endothelial cells involve controling renal blood flow, regulating glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and managing perfusion pressure. They do this by contracting and relaxing, effectively narrowing and widening the arteriole's lumen thereby controling the volume and rate of blood flow to the peritubular capillaries and creating the pressure gradient necessary for filtration in the glomerulus. 
Furthermore, kidney efferent arteriole endothelial cells show a high degree of plasticity in response to pathophysiological stimuli and can undergo structural and functional changes based on local needs. In conditions like hypertension and diabetes, these cells can experience hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction, contributing to the progression of renal disease.

These particular cells are located in the ascending limb of the vasa recta, which takes blood flow from the medulla back to the cortex. 
The primary function of vasa recta ascending limb cells is to preserve the renal medulla's hypertonicity, necessary for the kidney's urine concentration mechanism. Unlike the vasa recta descending limb cells, the venous-like epithelial cells of the ascending vasa recta are highly fenestrated and lack pericyte coverage, which facilitates water reuptake. 
As the blood flows through the ascending limb, it loses solutes and gains water, which is driven by the high solute concentration in the surrounding interstitium. This process acts in concert with cellular action in the descending limb and contributions from the so-called Loop of Henle, which helps with water and sodium chloride retrieval from the urine.
In the context of normal physiological processes, the function of the vasa recta ascending limb cells is essential in maintaining the body's overall fluid balance, electrolyte concentration, and systemic blood pressure. Any dysfunction in these cells may lead to impaired urine concentration or dilution capability of the kidney, potentially resulting in conditions like diabetes insipidus or hyponatremia.

In contrast to vasa recta ascending limb cells, the arterial-like epithelial cells of the descending vasa recta are non-fenestrated and covered by a pericyte layer that regulates the medullary blood flow. They help keeping the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance in check through a process known as countercurrent exchange system, in which the cells of the descending limb are permeable to water but relatively impermeable to solutes, such as sodium and urea. As the blood descends into the medulla along its descending limb, water passively diffuses out of the vasa recta, concentrating the blood in solutes.
In addition to their central role in water and solute exchange, these cells contribute to maintaining the medullary osmotic gradient, a critical function to concentrate urine. The osmotic gradient is created by the counterflow of water and solutes between the descending and ascending limbs of the vasa recta and the adjacent Loop of Henle. The selective permeability of the descending limb cells allows them to maintain this gradient, which in turn helps to conserve water, a vital role in the overall function of the renal system.

These unique cells are specialized to withstand the highly variable and sometimes harsh conditions present in the urinary system. Their key function is maintaining the barrier integrity of the urinary tract even when exposed to high volumes of urine and its solutes, and they play a crucial role in protecting underlying tissues from damage and infection.
The bladder urothelial cells exhibit a remarkable spectrum of phenotypic versatility and have an extraordinary capacity to stretch and retract based on the degree of bladder filling and emptying. In their relaxed state, these cells appear large and cuboidal, but upon stretching, they become thinner and exhibit a squamous cell-like appearance. This distinctive feature enables them to adjust to the changes in the urinary bladder volume while remaining impermeable to urinary solutes, thereby preventing a potential toxicity to the bladder wall and infiltration into the bloodstream.
Apart from their barrier function, bladder urothelial cells also express a number of sensor molecules or respond to thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli and can release signaling molecules, thereby playing a key role in sensory mechanisms that communicate vital information about the bladder's mechanical state to the nervous system. This communication helps regulate the micturition cycle and maintain urinary continence. Recent studies have also indicated that these cells may play a role in immune responses, highlighting their importance in bladder physiology. 
Altered proliferation and differentiation of bladder urothelial cells are implicated in various diseases and conditions such as bladder cancer, interstitial cystitis, and urinary tract infections.

Urothelial cells form the urothelium – a stratified, transitional epithelium lining the bladder, ureters, renal pelvis and urethra. These cells are highly adapted to their specific environment and maintain the crucial function of sustaining the urinary tract's core roles, primarily to transit and store urine without auto-corrosion or pathogen proliferation.
Within the urethra urothelial cells are primarily found in proximal two-thirds of the urethra, while the distal third is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells. The urothelial cells are renowned for their remarkable impermeability and ability to stretch and recoil during the various stages of urine filling and emptying. They form a tight barrier that prevents reabsorption of harmful byproducts and toxic substances present in the urine, guarding the deeper tissues and bloodstream against potential damage. This is largely attributed to specialized junctions, namely zonulae occludentes or tight junctions, in the umbrella cell layer (one of three layers of the urothelium) that seal the intercellular space between adjacent cells. Together with the urothelial plaque (an apical membrane plaque comprised of uroplakin proteins covering the umbrella cells at the luminal surface), the junctional complexes form a very effective permeability barrier that regulates the passage of water and ion from urine to the underlying tissue. 
A noteworthy feature of urothelial cells is their regulatory and sensory roles involving communication with the underlying layers about the filling and emptying status of the urinary tract. The cells also manage a fine balance between proliferation and differentiation, with the basal cells providing a ready pool of cells to replace the superficial layer when damaged. Their remarkable ability for regeneration and turnover, and their response to signals for repair underpins the durability and functionality of the urothelial tract.

Principal cells are located at the final segments of the renal tubules, where they play a pivotal role in key homeostatic processes.
One of their fundamental functions of kidney collecting duct principal cells is the regulation of water reabsorption, which is mediated by aquaporins (water channel proteins). Antidiuretic hormones, such as vasopressin, can stimulate the redistribution of these water channels from an intracellular pools to the apical plasma membrane of the principal cell; translocation of aquaporin (specifically, AQP2) is associated with an increase of osmotic water permeability. The water reabsorption affects the concentration of the final urine; these cells are therefore directly involved in the maintenance of the body's fluid balance.
Kidney collecting duct principal cells also participate in sodium and potassium ions regulation. They reabsorb sodium ions from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream, a process facilitated by the action of aldosterone, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. Similarly, the principal cells secrete potassium ions into the tubular fluid in response to aldosterone, contributing to the regulation of potassium levels in the body. Impaired function of cells can lead to various renal diseases and disorders, highlighting the vital role of kidney collecting duct principal cells in the body's homeostatic processes.

It is among the main cells that line this final component of the nephron, crucial in the physiological system that maintains acid-base homeostasis. This unique cell type comes in mainly three subtypes as per the localization of their proton pumps: type A, type B, and non-A, non-B cells. Each subtype plays different roles in regulating acid-base balance and electrolyte homeostasis in the body under varying physiological conditions. 
Type A intercalated cells reabsorb bicarbonate and secrete protons into urine, leading to the production of acidic urine. These cells are typically prevalent on the renal cortex and function particularly in states of metabolic acidosis or potassium depletion. On the other hand, type B intercalated cells secrete bicarbonate and reabsorb protons; thus, they are crucial in alkaline urine production and potassium conservation. These cells are essential to counter metabolic alkalosis or situations of potassium surplus. The non-A, non-B cells have the characteristic features of both type A and B cells, but play a prominent role under conditions of chronically elevated aldosterone and angiotensin II levels. 
Through their differentiated roles, intercalated cells also facilitate the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions, and water to maintain osmolarity. These cells' activity is finely regulated by hormonal signals like aldosterone, angiotensin II, vasopressin, and the parathyroid hormone. Intercalated cell activity can undergo a significant transformation under pathological conditions, and their dysregulation is associated with diseases such as distal renal tubular acidosis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.

Intestinal enteroendocrine cells also serve as the body's frontline of defense, playing an integral role in surveillance against lumen-occurring hazards including pathogen attack. Enteroendocrine cells are divided into ‘closed type’ and ‘open type’. Closed type cells are located close to the basal membrane and do not reach the lumen of the gut. In contrast, the apical side of the open-type intestinal enteroendocrine cells is directly exposed to luminal contents and thus can recognize bacterial metabolites and dietary nutrients. In response, these cells can modulate the immune system responses and thereby function as a key communicator between the gut microbiota and the host.

These cells line the inner surface of nearly all blood vessels that irrigate the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of the brain involved with complex cognitive functions such as thought, perception, and memory formation. Cerebral cortex endothelial cells are integral to maintaining brain health and function due to their role in regulating brain microenvironment and controlling the passage of essential molecules and cells.
The endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex are distinctive due to their highly selective permeability, largely attributable to the existence of unique tight junctions which maintain the barrier function of the BBB. The tightly interconnected structures of these cells prevent most substances from freely diffusing into the brain tissue, ensuring that harmful agents such as toxins, pathogens, or peripheral immune cells don't reach the brain and compromise its function. These cells also express multiple transporters and enzymes, allowing the selective entry of necessary nutrients and metabolites while excluding toxic substances.
Cerebral cortex endothelial cells also participate in neurovascular coupling, a process where localized neuronal activity increases cerebral blood flow to satisfy the local metabolic demands. The endothelial cells work in coordination with neurons and other cell types such as astrocytes and pericytes to mediate this process. They have been thought to regulate local blood flow by releasing substances in response to neuronal activity. Additionally, these cells are involved in many pathological conditions. Breakdown or dysfunction of the BBB often marked by altered endothelial cell function is linked to numerous neurological disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and brain tumors.

Their conversion from endometrial fibroblast to a secretory phenotype, known as decidualization, occurs as a normal process in the menstrual cycle or in response to embryo implantation.
With crucial roles in regulating maternal immune responses and placental development, decidual cells have a twofold function: preventing rejection of the conceptus by the mother's immune system and guiding placental development to avoid excessive trophoblast invasion leading to pre-eclampsia. During decidualization, these cells secrete proteins and growth factors supporting embryo implantation and sustaining early pregnancy. Furthermore, decidual cells modulate the activities of natural killer cells, macrophages, and T cells in the uterus, maintaining a balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory conditions during pregnancy.

These cells are organized into a single layer, forming an integral part of the lymphatic system which acts as the body's secondary circulatory system. The primary function of dermis lymphatic vessel endothelial cells is to facilitate the transportation and regulation of the lymph fluid within the dermis. They act as a barrier, contributing to fluid homeostasis, lipid transport, and immune cell trafficking. These cells are uniquely equipped to let fluid and larger molecules, including proteins and immune cells, into the lymphatic vessels from the surrounding interstitial space. This is enabled by the specialized junctions between the endothelial cells and the presence of primary lymphatic valves that prevent the backflow of lymph.
Another paramount role of dermis lymphatic vessel endothelial cells is their involvement in immune response. By interacting with white blood cells, especially T-cells and dendritic cells, they can mediate local immune surveillance and contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses. These cells are also implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, including lymphedema and metastasis in cancer.

These specialized cells are predominantly located in the dermis, particularly on the face, scalp, and upper body. 
The primary function of sebaceous gland cells is the production and secretion of sebum, a complex mixture of lipids including triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, and metabolites of fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin E), as well as free fatty acids. The production process involves a unique form of programmed cell death called holocrine secretion. In this process, as sebaceous gland cells mature, they progressively accumulate lipid droplets, before ultimately disintegrating and releasing their lipid-rich contents into the gland's ductal system. 
The sebum generated by these cells serves multiple purposes. It acts as a waterproofing agent, preventing excessive wetting or drying of the skin and averaging skin's water-holding capacity. Sebum also has antimicrobial properties, providing a natural defense barrier against certain bacterial and fungal species. Additionally, it contributes to the skin’s suppleness and prevents it from becoming brittle. An overproduction or imbalance of sebaceous gland cells can lead to common skin disorders, such as acne, seborrhea, or rosacea, illustrating their importance in skin health.

They exhibit unique features, including centrally located nuclei, robust cytoskeletal structures, high mitochondria content, and intercalated discs, which contribute to their efficient pumping of blood throughout the body. 
The main role of ventricular cardiac muscle cells is to coordinate contractions, enabling the heart to pump blood throughout the body. This is achieved through controlled ion movement across cell membranes, generating rhythmic electrical signals called action potentials. Intercalated discs between these cells aid synchronized contractions by allowing efficient signal spread through gap junctions. The high mitochondrial content ensures a constant energy supply for this ongoing contraction cycle.
Ventricular cardiac muscle cells contribute not only mechanically but also biochemically by secreting essential hormones like atrial natriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide for blood pressure regulation and cardiac remodeling. These cells exhibit low turnover under normal conditions, emphasizing their long-term stability, yet have limited regenerative capacity following cardiac injuries. Dysfunction in these cells can result in significant cardiac issues, including heart failure.

Structurally, placental villous trophoblasts are situated on the villous tree structures, forming an outer epithelial layer. Comprising two subtypes—proliferating cytotrophoblasts forming the inner layer and terminally differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts constituting the outer layer in contact with maternal blood—these cells define the placental architecture.
Functionally, placental villous trophoblasts play pivotal roles in forming and maintaining the placenta, ensuring the safe development of the fetus. Their primary function involves managing substance exchange between the mother and fetus, mediating the transfer of gases, nutrients, hormones, and waste materials to support optimal fetal growth. Additionally, these trophoblasts synthesize and release crucial hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which maintains the decidua and signals the mother's body to sustain pregnancy. Acting as a physical and immunological barrier, they protect the fetus from maternal immune cells and prevent the transmission of pathogens, contributing significantly to the success of pregnancy.
