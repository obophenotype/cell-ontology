Mononuclear phagocytes are characterized by the presence of a single, large nucleus. The ‘Mononuclear Phagocyte System’ nomenclature was introduced to distinguish mononuclear monocytes and macrophages from other cells with multiple nuclei. However, the cells within the mononuclear phagocyte system represent a highly heterogeneous group, all of which are able to perform highly efficient phagocytosis - engulfing and digesting microbes and cellular debris to fight infections and to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. 
In addition to phagocytosis, mononuclear phagocytes also secrete chemical compounds to recruit other immune cells to a site of infection. These cells produce different types of signaling molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, triggering a cascade of responses to ensure rapid and efficient containment and neutralization of invading pathogens. These cells are also involved in antigen presentation, a process essential for stimulating an adaptive immune response. They can process and present antigens to T cells, thereby linking the innate and adaptive immune responses.
Mononuclear phagocytes play key roles in tissue repair and remodeling. After infection or injury, these cells help in the clearance of dead cells and debris, a crucial step in the initiation of tissue remodeling and the resolution of inflammation. Overall, mononuclear phagocytes are versatile cells that have tailored their functions to meet the unique challenges of different tissues within the body. They are pivotal in homeostasis, immunity, and inflammation, making them important aspects in a range of human diseases including infection, autoimmunity, and cancer.

They constitute approximately half of the total cells in the human brain and more than half in other parts of the nervous system. Glial cells perform several key functions including, but not limited to, maintaining homeostasis, forming the myelin sheath around the neuron axons, and providing support and nutrition to neurons.
These different functions are performed by various glial cell types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and other specialized types. Astrocytes, for example, are the most abundant glial cells and provide metabolic and nutrient support to neurons, help regulate the extracellular ion and neurotransmitter levels, and play a role in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, contributing to the overall homeostasis and functioning of the nervous system. Additionally, astrocytes are involved in synaptic communication and participate in processes such as synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning.
Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system function to insulate neurons by producing a fatty substance known as myelin. The myelin sheath enhances the speed and efficiency of nerve impulse conduction along the axons. 
Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, protect neurons from pathogens and clear away dead neurons through phagocytosis, a process also known as cellular eating. They also contribute to the regulation of inflammation in response to signals of tissue damage or infection in the central nervous system by releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules that modulate the immune response.
Despite their overarching function in the support and protection of neurons, glial cells have also been shown to play significant roles in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and multiple sclerosis.

Macrophages can also originate from circulating monocytes that differentiate into macrophages upon migration into body tissues. 
Macrophages are involved in the detection, phagocytosis, and destruction of bacteria and other pathogens. They are also responsible for engulfing and removing dead cells and debris. Macrophages are also one of the cells that present pathogenic antigens to T cells so that the pathogens may be recognized and killed, or so that an antibody response may be mounted. They can also secrete cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes that further orchestrate the immune response.
Tissue-resident macrophages are diverse and heterogenous, likely as a result of the signals received from the tissue environment. The functions of these macrophages are specific to each tissue and contribute to tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of macrophage functioning may also contribute to the development of various disease processes, such as fibrosis, chronic inflammation, or cancer.

They are derived from hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells and can be found throughout the body poised as sentinels in locations such as the skin, lungs, or liver, as well as immune organs such as the thymus, lymph nodes, or spleen. They can also be found in an immature state in the blood. Dendritic cells serve as antigen-presenting cells, with a primary function of processing and presenting antigens to T-cells to facilitate an immune response.
Upon encountering an antigen, dendritic cells engulf the pathogen via phagocytosis and subsequently process the pathogen into antigens. These antigens are then presented on the surface of the dendritic cell in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The dendritic cell migrates to the lymph nodes, containing naive T-cells, and presents the antigens to them. This process triggers the activation of cognate T-cells into effector T-cells, which can then recognize and eradicate cells bearing the same antigen.
Additionally, the dendritic cells can influence the type of immune response the body will mount. They communicate with T-cells through the use of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines. Depending on the type of co-stimulatory molecules used and the set of cytokines released, dendritic cells can promote the development of a cellular immune response, dominated by cytotoxic T cells effective against intracellular pathogens such as viruses, a humoral response, mediated by B cells and effective against extracellular bacteria and toxins, or a tolerogenic response. Thus, dendritic cells play a pivotal role in immunity, helping the body to effectively combat infections, prevent autoimmune diseases, and maintain tolerance to healthy self-tissues.

The stroma is the connective, supportive framework of biological tissues with various functions depending on the specific organ and cell type. Stromal cells, derived from the mesenchymal lineage, play crucial roles in creating, maintaining, and repairing the tissue microenvironment in virtually all mammalian organs, making these cells indispensable to biological function.
Additionally, stromal cells secrete growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules to constitute an interactive cellular network and ensure an optimal environment for the functional cells. Beyond mere structural support, these cells are instrumental in wound healing, inflammation, and maintaining tissue integrity. They may also influence the behavior of other cell types through direct cell-cell interactions or paracrine signaling.
Clinically and in research, stromal cells often draw attention due to their interaction with tumors in the cancer microenvironment. Over the past years, the role of stromal cells as facilitators of tumor growth and metastasis has been recognized increasingly. They contribute to cancer progression not only by modulating the ECM but also through the secretion of various bioactive molecules and interacting with immune cells, thereby influencing the immunologic responses to tumors.

They feature prominently in the human body's first line of defense against foreign substances as a part of the innate immune system. Monocytes are the largest of all circulating leukocytes and are identified by their bean-shaped nucleus. They are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream; in some conditions, they may enter tissues and differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells or a distinct monocyte-derived cell.
Monocytes function effectively as phagocytes, devouring harmful pathogens in the body. They engulf and destroy microbes, foreign substances, cancer cells, and other materials detrimental to the body's well-being. This process, known as phagocytosis, is vital for the body's immune response. Monocytes are also equipped to identify harmful pathogens and alert other immune cells to their presence. This is achieved by producing proinflammatory cytokines that recruit other immune cells to the affected area, amplifying the immune response.
Beyond their role in fighting infections, monocytes play an important role in the repair and healing of tissues. After an infection or inflammation subsides, monocytes can transition into different types of cells and assist in healing by clearing dead cells and debris and facilitating tissue regeneration. They are crucial in wound healing, control of microbial growth, and tissue development.

These cells are named after their location in the intestines (“entero”) and because they are stainable by chromium salts (“chromaffin”). 
The primary function of type EC enteroendocrine cells is to act as chemosensors and lies in their capacity to produce and secrete serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in modulating motility, secretion, vasodilation, perception of pain, and appetite in the gastrointestinal system. However, its function is not limited to the gastrointestinal tract; once secreted, serotonin is distributed via the bloodstream and contributes to regulating mood, appetite, and sleep in the brain. 
Via specific chemosensory receptors type EC enteroendocrine cells are able to respond to various environmental, metabolic, and homeostatic stimuli and transduce information from the gut to the nervous system: Food intake, particularly the ingestion of fats and carbohydrates, prompts these cells to produce and release serotonin; the mechanical stimulus of food in the lumen can also trigger release. The distribution, function, and responsiveness of type EC cells reveal them as a crucial link between the intestinal environment, the nervous system, and the regulation of numerous bodily functions.

These specialized immune cells form a crucial part of the body's defense mechanism, playing important roles in pulmonary health and homeostasis. They are the first line of defense in the pulmonary immune response, acting as scavengers that patrol the alveoli and engulf foreign particles like bacteria, dust, and other debris that enter the lungs through inhalation.
The primary function of these alveolar macrophages is phagocytosis, whereby they consume and digest foreign substances, dead cells, and other particulates. In the lung, alveolar macrophages are also responsible for clearing surfactant. Additionally, alveolar macrophages also play an integral role in initiating the immune response, as they secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit other immune cells to the site of infection or inflammation.
Beyond their role in host defense, alveolar macrophages contribute to tissue remodeling and wound repair in the lungs, aiding in maintaining lung integrity. They also regulate local inflammation and control the immune response to prevent excessive inflammation that may be harmful. However, an imbalance in the function of alveolar macrophages can contribute to various lung diseases. Abnormal alveolar macrophage activation has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as emphysema, asthma, and fibrosis.

They are characterized by the presence of the CD8 glycoprotein on their cell surface and the alpha and beta chains in their T cell receptors (TCRs). CD8+ T cells primarily function as cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), their specialized role in the immune response being to detect and eliminate cells presenting foreign or abnormal antigens on their surfaces.
Naïve CD8+ T cells patrol the central lymphoid organs, checking peptide– MHC class I molecule complexes for the presence of their cognate antigen on antigen-presenting cells. Recognition of the foreign antigen by the TCR and interaction with MHC class I molecules triggers a series of events leading to the activation of the CD8+ T cell. Once activated, the CD8+ T cell divides, matures, and differentiates into effector T cells capable of destroying the target cells. This cytotoxic function is carried out by the release of substances like perforin and granzymes, which induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the target cells.
In addition to their cytotoxic function, CD8+ T cells are known to release various cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). These are potent mediators of the immune response and have roles in shaping the immune response and the inflammatory reaction. 
Following the resolution of an immune response, a small subset of activated CD8+ T cells persists as memory T cells, providing a quicker and more vigorous response upon subsequent encounters with the same antigen. These capabilities make CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cells indispensable for the body's defense against infections and malignant transformations.

They are defined by expression of heterodimeric T-cell receptors (TCRs) comprised of γ and δ chains. They share characteristics with both innate and adaptive immune cells, and unlike alpha-beta (αβ) T cells, they do not require antigen processing and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) presentation for the recognition of antigens. This unique response mechanism allows them to contribute to rapid immune responses, particularly in the context of tissue injury and infection.
Depending on the γδ TCR and the context, different subsets of gamma-delta T cells perform a variety of functions which range from regulating thermogenesis in adipose tissue to controlling the plasticity of neuronal synapses in the central nervous system. A key function is in tissue homeostasis and surveillance against infectious agents and tumors. 
They can carry out their defense role through several mechanisms, such as cytokine production, killing of target cells, and regulation of other immune cell responses. In response to pathogens, these cells produce a wide range of cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-17 (IL-17), which help recruit and activate other immune cells to the site of infection. Furthermore, gamma-delta T cells can directly kill infected cells or cancerous cells, which is instrumental in preventing the spread of infection or malignancy.
Despite the broadly generalized role in immunity, the function of gamma-delta T cells can vastly vary depending on their tissue location. In the skin and mucosal tissues, they provide quick response to pathogens, while in secondary lymphoid organs, their regulatory functions shape the adaptive immune response. In recent years, their role in the context of autoimmunity and cancer has gained attention, with emerging studies suggesting their potential for immunotherapeutic interventions. Thus, gamma-delta T cells serve as vital components of the immune system, providing a versatile defense mechanism against a range of pathogenic targets.

These cells play a critical role in creating a barrier between the lymphatic system and the surrounding tissues. They are structurally different from the endothelial cells of the blood vessels due to the presence of anchoring filaments and lack of a continuous basement membrane, and have a unique phenotype marked by the expression of various cell-specific markers such as Prox-1, VEGFR-3, and LYVE-1.
A significant function of these endothelial cells is to maintain the fluid balance within the body. They facilitate the uptake of excess interstitial fluid that collects in the body tissues, and ensure its transport back into the bloodstream via the lymphatic vessels. These cells also enable the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system, and their subsequent transport in the form of chyle, a milky fluid, to the blood.
Furthermore, endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels play a pivotal role in the body's immune response. They enable the passage of lymphocytes, that are crucial for the body's defense mechanism, from the tissues into the lymph where these cells are activated to fight against foreign bodies and infections. Also, they regulate inflammation reactions by controlling the migration of inflammatory cells, and are thus involved in pathological conditions with an inflammatory component. Lastly, these cells have been noted for their involvement in various disease states related to tissue edema, metastasis, and tumor growth, thus highlighting their importance in both health and disease states.

After extraction, these cells can grow and reproduce when provided with the appropriate nutrients. The establishment of primary cell cultures involves processes like tissue dissection, enzymatic or mechanical disaggregation, suspension, and plating. These cells closely mimic the biochemical and physiological conditions of cells in vivo, providing a more realistic model of biological function compared to other cell culture systems.
Retaining most physiological and morphological characteristics of the original tissue, primary cultured cells are a powerful tool for modeling diseases, drug responses, and basic biological functions such as synthesis and metabolism. They find extensive use in research fields such as cellular biology, genetics, pharmacology, oncology, and toxicology.
Despite their genetic stability, primary cultured cells have a finite lifespan and are not immortal. They undergo senescence after a specific number of population doublings, influenced by genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. Given their limited lifespan, primary cells are crucial for experimental replicability, and their cultivation demands meticulous care to prevent changes that might alter cell identity or function.

Through a complex process called spermatogenesis in the testes male germ cells undergo several stages of development, each with distinctive morphological and physiological characteristics, eventually differentiating into mature spermatozoa (sperm). 
Male germ cells are responsible for transferring genetic material from male to offspring as part of sexual reproduction. In the initial stage of their life cycle, they exist as spermatogonial stem cells, which multiply by mitotic division to self-renew and to produce daughter cells. The daughter cells then undergo meiotic division, a process that reduces the number of chromosomes in each cell by half, from diploid to haploid – the formation of spermatids. This is critical for maintaining genetic stability from generation to generation, as it ensures that when an egg and sperm cell unite during fertilization, the resulting offspring will have the correct number of chromosomes. The final phase of spermatogenesis is called spermiogenesis, during which spermatozoa - mature and motile sperm cells – are produced from round spermatids. 
The matured male germ cells or sperm cells are highly specialized, having a streamlined shape designed for efficient movement towards the female egg. A sperm cell is divided into three main parts, namely the head, midpiece, and tail. The head contains the genetic material, the midpiece contains mitochondria that provide energy, and the tail, termed as the flagellum, propels the sperm cell forward. Each of these parts play significant roles in fertilization.

Produced in the male reproductive organs, specifically the testes, sperm cells play an important role in the process of fertilization, where they fuse with a female gamete or egg cell (ovum) to form a zygote, which marks the beginning of a new organism.
Sperm cells hold several unique traits that set them apart from other body cells. Structurally, a sperm cell possesses two main structures: the head, containing the nucleus carrying the paternal genetic information, and the flagellum, which generates energy and grants the sperm cell mobility
The process of fertilization occurs when one sperm cell successfully penetrates the egg, delivering its genetic information, and ultimately leading to the formation of a new individual combining both paternal and maternal genetic materials. Notably, while hundreds of millions of sperm cells may be released during ejaculation, only one has the opportunity to successfully fertilize the egg, underscoring the highly competitive nature of this biological process.

There are two main types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos and can develop into any type of cell in the body. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, are found in various tissues and organs throughout the body and can only develop into certain types of cells.
Stem cells have numerous potential applications in medicine, including the treatment of various diseases and the repair of damaged tissues. For example, they could be used to replace damaged heart tissue after a heart attack or to repair spinal cord injuries. Stem cells also have potential uses in drug development and disease research, as they can be used to model diseases and test potential therapies in vitro.

During embryonic development hematopoietic stem cells emerge from the hemogenic endothelium, a specialized subset of endothelial cells with hematopoietic potential. HSCs can be found in several organs, in particular in bone marrow, as well as peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood.
These stem cells have a distinctive ability to self-renew, and to differentiate into all lymphoid and myeloid cell types that together form the blood and immune systems including erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and platelets. Their primary function is to ensure the continuous replenishment of the blood and immune system throughout an individual's lifespan.
In response to various signals, hematopoietic stem cells can either remain dormant or actively divide and differentiate. Under normal conditions, the majority of these stem cells exist in a quiescent (inactive) state, making them somewhat resistant to chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the treatment of various diseases such as leukemia. However, when the body encounters stress such as infection, bleeding, or disease, hematopoietic stem cells can rapidly become active in order to replenish the affected cells and maintain homeostasis.
Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cells are extremely important in the field of regenerative medicine and transplantation. Regarded as lifesaving in the field of oncology, they are often extracted, purified, and reinfused back into the same (autologous transplantation) or different (allogeneic transplantation) individuals to reestablish a healthy, functioning hematopoietic and immune system after high-dose chemotherapy or to replace dysfunctional bone marrow. Understanding and manipulating the behavior of these stem cells has immense potential in treating various blood disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancers.

Found within the bone marrow, these cells are dedicated precursors to erythrocytes, and ensue in the hematopoietic lineage from multipotent progenitors. They represent a transitional cell type that bridges the gap between the early-stage erythroid precursors and the maturing red blood cell population.
The earliest committed erythroid progenitor cell is thought to be the burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cell, which after several cell divisions gives rise to another erythroid progenitor, the colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cell. 
Erythroid progenitor cells are primarily responsible for responding to the demand for new red blood cells during conditions of physiological stress like infection, blood loss, or illness. This responsive behavior is regulated by a glycoprotein hormone known as erythropoietin, which is produced by the kidneys. Erythropoietin interacts with the receptors on the erythroid progenitor cells, prompting them to proliferate and differentiate into erythroblasts. The erythroblasts then further mature, eventually producing new, functional red cells.
The role of erythroid progenitor cells extends beyond their main function of erythrocyte production, as they also participate in maintaining the balance of iron in the body. Upon erythroid differentiation, they increase their uptake of transferrin-bound iron for hemoglobin synthesis, a vital component of red blood cells which allows them to transport oxygen. A deficiency or excess of erythroid progenitor cells can lead to extensive health issues such as anemia or polycythemia respectively, emphasizing their crucial role in human health.

This part of the hematopoiesis process leads to the formation of myeloid lineage cells, which includes granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes, erythrocytes (red blood cells), and megakaryocytes (platelet-forming cells). 
The primary function of common myeloid progenitors is differentiation and proliferation into various types of mature blood cells, thereby providing a critical contribution to maintaining homeostasis within the body's immune and circulatory systems. Single-cell analyses have shown that the CMP cell population is heterogeneous with at least two distinct subpopulations, characterized by different cell surface markers and likely already committed to downstream differentiation into either the granulocyte/macrophage lineage or the megakaryocyte/erythrocyte lineage-restricted progenitor. 
The destiny of a CMP is influenced by numerous cytokines and growth factors in its environment that promote differentiation along specific lineages. For example, IL-3 and GM-CSF stimulate the production of eosinophils, which are essential for the body’s defense against allergens and help fight fungal and parasitic infections. 
By being able to differentiate into a wide range of different immune cells, common myeloid progenitors play a crucial role in the body's ability to respond to injuries, infections, and other physiological challenges.

They are found in the bone marrow, the primary organ where new blood cells are generated. MEPs are specially programmed to develop into two distinct blood cell lineages, namely megakaryocytes, which go on to produce platelets for blood clotting, and the erythroid lineage which consists of red blood cells responsible for oxygen transport in the body.
The MEP cells are the result of a decision-making process within the hematopoietic stem cell population. Hematopoietic stem cell can differentiate into multiple types of progenitor cells, including myeloid progenitor cells. A further subdivision within this myeloid lineage generates the MEP cells. Therefore, these megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors represent a key juncture between hematopoietic stem cells and mature blood cell types in the myeloid lineage.
Megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells play a crucial role in the homeostasis of some of the most crucial constituents of blood. The megakaryocytes produced from these bipotent progenitor cells contribute to hemostasis by producing platelets - small anucleated fragments that are pivotal for blood clotting and preventing bleeding. Similarly, the erythroid lineage from MEP cells gives rise to erythrocytes, which harbor hemoglobin, the molecule that transports oxygen from lungs to every nook and corner of the body. An imbalance or malfunction in MEP function thus can significantly impact human health, leading to diseases like thrombocytopenia or anemia.

Hematopoietic stem cells have the unique capability of developing into any type of blood cell depending on the body's requirements. In contrast, common lymphoid progenitors are already committed to the lymphoid lineage but are still oligopotent with the capability to further differentiate into various types of lymphoid cells. 
In mice, cells in the common lymphoid progenitor population in the bone marrow can be identified by their Lin- IL7rα+ c-Kit+ Sca-1+ cell surface phenotype. The IL-7 receptor is first expressed on common lymphoid progenitor cells and distinguishes them from primitive common myeloid progenitors, and IL-7 is thought to play a critical role in the downstream development and homeostasis of immune cells.
CLPs give rise to B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, all of which play a crucial and distinct role in immune responses. B and T lymphocytes are responsible for adaptive immunity, allowing the body to recognize and remember specific pathogens to fight them off more effectively in the future. B lymphocytes are responsible for producing antibodies, while T lymphocytes either help regulate immune responses or directly kill infected cells. Natural Killer cells are part of the body’s innate immune response, providing immediate, nonspecific defense against pathogens. They are able to interact with infected or malignant cells and induce controlled cell death, or apoptosis, effectively eliminating the threat to bodily health. Dendritic cells link the innate and adaptive immune systems by presenting antigens to T cells, promoting an adaptive response.
Thus, common lymphoid progenitors provide the basis for the body's strategic and layered defense against varied and evolving external threats, making them an essential part of the immune system.

The primary function of osteoblasts is to synthesize and deposit bone matrix, a mixture of organic substances and inorganic materials. This included producing a mix of collagen and non-collagenous proteins, which they secrete to create the organic portion of the extracellular bone matrix. The osteoblasts also initiate the mineralization process by depositing calcium and phosphate ions onto this organic matrix, generating a material that is incredibly strong and resilient, which we recognize as bone. 
Furthermore, osteoblasts are intricately involved in bone remodeling. They communicate with other specialized bone cells, like osteoclasts (involved in bone resorption) and osteocytes (derived from osteoblasts and important for bone maintenance), helping to maintain skeletal health and homeostasis. Dysregulation of osteoblast function can lead to various bone diseases, illustrating the importance of these cells in skeletal health and development.

Additionally, these cells may also function in aiding the migration of neuroblasts during brain development.
Ependymal cells form a barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid and the adjacent nervous tissue in the central nervous system, which appears to be particularly important during development.

These cells exhibit tight junctions, enabling the careful regulation of the passage of substances and ensuring that no unwanted particles seep through. They are predominantly characterized by their polarized nature, having distinct apical and basolateral surfaces that support its functions of secretion and absorption. The apical surface, exposed to the duct lumen, is specialized for secretion and interaction with the luminal environment, while the basolateral surface is oriented towards the underlying tissue, facilitating interactions with neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix.
The ducts serve as the bridge between the gland and the site of secretion, allowing the substances produced by the gland to exit into the body. Thus, duct epithelial cells have a sweeping role in various physiological functions, ranging from defense against pathogens in the respiratory and digestive tracts, to secretion of digestive enzymes, to milk production in mammary glands.
As a result of their specialized function, any impairment in the function of duct epithelial cells to function properly often leads to certain diseases or disorders. Studies have identified potential correlation between malfunctioning duct epithelial cells and conditions such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and certain cancers, particularly breast and pancreatic.

These cells form a single, continuous monolayer inside every blood vessel, acting as a crucial biomolecular barrier between the blood, and the rest of the body tissues. They perform various fundamental biological functions, ranging from maintenance of vessel integrity to blood clotting regulation. Additionally, they control the transportation of fluids, molecules, and blood particulate matter from and into the bloodstream.
One of the primary functions of blood vessel endothelial cells is to maintain vascular homeostasis - a stable environment within the blood vessels. They accomplish this through several methods: they control vasomotor tone, i.e. the degree of contraction and dilation of blood vessels, by secreting vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide and endothelin; mediate responses to inflammatory stimuli; and they also regulate angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formations. Blood vessel endothelial cells play a significant role in preventing blood clot formation by generating a slick, non-thrombogenic surface that disallows platelets or coagulant proteins from adhering to it.
Blood vessel endothelial cells are sensitive to various stimuli, including shear stress caused by blood flow, and they can respond by altering their morphology, function, and gene expression. This ability to adapt enables blood vessels to remodel and ensure the adequate delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues, regardless of physiological demand variations. Conversely, endothelial dysfunction, often associated with a reduction in the bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, can lead to the development of pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and even aging-related diseases.

Upon encountering an allergen, pathogen, or even certain drugs and toxins, mast cells release these mediators via degranulation. Histamine induces vasodilation and vascular permeability, allowing for immune cells to rapidly reach the site of infection, while heparin prevents clotting in these areas to facilitate immune cell recruitment. Mast cells may also selectively secrete mediators without degranulation.
These cells also play other functions beyond immune defense. They are involved in wound healing processes and maintenance of tissue integrity, angiogenesis, and even regulation of physiological functions in the gut. Consequently, because of their wide-ranging impacts, abnormalities in mast cell function can result in various disorders, including those related to allergies, inflammation, and autoimmune conditions.

Located within the central nervous system (CNS), motor neurons in the motor cortex travel to the brainstem and spinal cord. Motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord extend their lengthy axons out to muscles throughout the body. These specialized neurons are an inherent part of the so-called somatic division of the nervous system which mediates conscious control of skeletal muscles.
The primary function of motor neurons is to relay signals from the CNS to the body's many muscles, controlling both their contraction and relaxation. In response to impulses transmitted from the brain or spinal cord, it creates an electrical signal (action potential), which travels along its axon to cause the controlled movement of specific muscles. Motor neurons can connect with skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, or glands, leading to three respective types: somatic motor neurons, autonomic motor neurons, and the neurons of the enteric nervous system.
Key components of motor neurons include the cell body (soma), dendrites, and axons. The cell body houses the nucleus and is the site of the neuron's intrinsic functions. Dendrites are thin structures that branch from the cell body and receive messages (electrical signals) from other neurons. The axon, a long, single tail-like extension, carries these signals away from the cell body towards the targeted muscle. If a motor neuron is damaged or dies, the muscle or gland it controls can lose function, which can result in conditions like motor neuron disease, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy.

These specialized cells possess two distinctive extensions or processes - one axon and one dendrite, emerging from the cell body on opposite ends, which gives them their bipolar appearance. These two extensions serve as conduits for electrical signals, with the dendrite primarily playing the role of receiving signals, and the axon transmitting them further.
Functionally, bipolar neurons are crucial in facilitating the transmission of special senses, particularly in the senses of sight, smell, hearing, and balance. For example, the bipolar neurons in the retina convey information about light intensity, color, and movement from the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells, forming part of the pathway for visual input to travel towards the brain. 
Similarly, in the olfactory system, the olfactory cells are bipolar neurons characterized by a peripheral process, called the olfactory rod, which projects fine cilia. These cilia are the sites of olfactory receptors which play a critical role in recognizing thousands of odorant molecules and transmit information about smell from the nose to the brain. 
Bipolar neurons are also involved in hearing. The vestibular ganglion contains thousands of bipolar neurons that receive sensory signals from hair cells in the inner ear. The nerve signals pass through the bipolar neurons and leave along the vestibular nerve. 
The morphology of bipolar neurons with their single dendrite and axon also subtly boosts their efficiency, maintaining a streamlined path for signal conduction. Their distinctive structuring allows for faster and more targeted relay of sensory information from the body's peripheries to the central nervous system. Loss or damage of these neurons would directly impact sensory reception and could lead to disorders related to vision, hearing, smell, or balance, underlining the significance of this cell type in the body's sensory capacity.

This cell type is distinctively known for its structural architecture and extraordinary capabilities in information processing. The multipolar configuration enables a wide branching network that supports the reception, integration, and transmission of signals over varying distances, translating into complex functionalities like thought, action, and perception.
The primary function of a multipolar neuron is to process and transmit information in the form of electrical impulses or action potentials. Each of the multiple dendrites acts as a receiver, collecting synaptic inputs from other neurons and transferring these signals to the neuron's cell body. Here, the information is assembled and, upon reaching a particular threshold, will trigger the generation of an action potential along the axon, the singular elongated projection that results in the neuron's output. This signal propagation, facilitated by the axon's myelination and nodes of Ranvier, leads to highly efficient and fast information transmission to other neurons, muscle cells, gland cells, and other organs.
The capacity of multipolar neurons to establish vast connections with other neurons makes them the primary constituents of the central nervous system. They play indispensable roles in both sensory and motor pathways, as well as in higher cognitive functions such as memory and learning. These neurons also enrich the autonomic system, contributing to both sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways. Hence, multipolar neurons play an essential role in performing and regulating a plethora of activities, ranging from basic reflexes to intricate cognitive processes.

The distinctive feature of the cerebellar Golgi cells is their dendritic arbor that extends throughout the molecular layer of the cerebellum, in line with the axons of the granule cells. The axons of Golgi cells primarily synapse with the dendrites of granule cells, generating a synaptic feedback loop that plays a vital role in regulating the intensity and timing of signal transmission. They also form synapses with mossy fiber terminals, which provide primary input to the cerebellar cortex.
Functionally, cerebellar Golgi cells serve as \"gatekeepers\" of the cerebellar cortex. They have a strong inhibitory influence on granule cells, modulating the information flow to the Purkinje cells, the main output neurons of the cerebellar cortex. Thus, Golgi cells play a critical role in controlling the input-output relationship within the cerebellum, shaping the timing and strength of signals originating from various sensory and motor areas of the cerebral cortex. This regulatory function is instrumental for the fine-tuning of motor coordination, timing and learning. Thus, alterations in Golgi cell functions can contribute to a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as ataxias and cognitive deficits.

Their name derives from the presence of internal granular structures and they are one of the most abundant cell types in the entire brain, with estimates suggesting they likely comprise over half of all neurons. Due to their location, these cells play a vital role in the modulation of motor coordination, the olfactory system, and some aspects of memory and learning.
Structurally, granule cells differ depending on their location. They have unmyelinated, very thin, T-shaped axons and a few short dendrites in the cerebellum. These dendrites receive information from a variety of sources, while their axons transmit the information to other parts of the brain. In granule cells of the cerebellum, the axons form parallel fibers that run into the molecular layer and synapse onto Purkinje cells, stellate, and basket cells, setting up a neuronal circuit critical for generating precise and fluid movements.
Functionally, granule cells receive excitatory input from mossy fibers, which deliver sensory and motor information to the cerebellum, and this interaction is fundamental for the timing and coordination of body movements. In the olfactory bulb, granule cells process and modify olfactory information before passing it to the cerebral cortex, thereby aiding smell perception. Meanwhile, in the hippocampus, these cells participate in the formation and sorting of memories, particularly episodic memories. Due to their number, location, and function, the granule cells have a significant influence on cognition and behavior.

They are a critical part of the vertebrate nervous system as they provide the only signal output from the cortex to the cerebellar nuclei. They are one of the few types of neurons that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. The most distinct hallmark of Purkinje cells is their elaborate dendritic arbor, which forms a broad and intricately branching structure resembling a tree. These numerous branches each receive excitatory synaptic inputs from more than 100,000 parallel fibers; in addition, a single climbing fiber makes hundreds of synapses to the soma and proximal dendrites. A single long axon forms an inhibitory projection to the cerebellar nuclei.
Purkinje cells play key roles in the coordination of fine, voluntary motor movements and balance. As the sole output of all motor coordination in the cerebellar cortex, they serve as a central relay in the cerebro-cerebellar loop. Each Purkinje cell receives two types of synaptic input: one from parallel fibers (which are axons of granule cells), and the other from climbing fibers (originating from the inferior olivary nucleus). The Purkinje cells process and integrate these diverse kinds of input signals to generate output that controls timing and coordination of movements.
Purkinje neurons show considerable synaptic plasticity. Throughout life, these cells continue to undergo long-term potentiation and depression at parallel fiber synapses, which cause long-lasting increase or decrease, respectively, of synaptic transmission and have been proposed as mechanisms for motor learning. 
Purkinje cells are also known to be implicated in a variety of diseases. Their progressive loss is a prime feature in certain types of ataxia, a collective term used to describe conditions characterized by loss of muscular control and coordination. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the density of Purkinje cells has been reported in conditions such as autism and Huntington’s disease.

Stellate neurons play a pivotal role in the processing and transmission of information within the brain. In the cerebellum, these neurons are predominantly inhibitory and release the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), effectively regulating the excitability of other neurons within the network and thus fine-tuning the neuron-to-neuron communication.

This widespread connectivity places stellate neurons at the heart of information processing in the central nervous system.
In addition to their important inhibitory role in regulating and processing information, the role of stellate neurons in the cerebellum differs slightly from their cortical counterparts. The cortical spiny stellate neurons are excitatory and release the neurotransmitter glutamate. They are involved in motor control and responsible for coordinating precise, voluntary movements and maintaining posture and balance. Any dysfunction in these cerebellar neurons can lead to movement disorders, highlighting their significance in our daily activities.

These cells are derived from progenitor cells in the yolk sac, which differentiates them from other types of glial cells (such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) that are derived from neuroectodermal cell lineages. 
The primary role of microglial cells is to act as the first and main active form of immune defense in the CNS. They express a vast repertoire of pattern recognition receptors, which allow them to sense and eliminate microbes invading the CNS parenchyma. They represent one of the macrophage populations of the CNS and are responsible for phagocytosis (engulfing and destroying cellular waste or pathogens) in the neural environment. 
Microglial cells are particularly responsive to pathogens and injuries and change their morphology in reaction to inflammation or insult: In the normal state they are characterized by a ramified shape with small processes; in response to stimuli, some microglia mature and change to an amoeboid shape. 
Beyond their macrophagic activity, they also perform synaptic pruning during brain development, eliminate unnecessarily produced neurons, and facilitate tissue regeneration and repair. they play integral roles in regulating neural development and supporting cell survival and are important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. 
While their protective role generally benefits the brain, their over-activation can occasionally lead to neuro-inflammatory diseases, underlining the importance of balanced microglial cell functions. They have been extensively studied for their association with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

The primary function of gut endothelial cells lies in their ability to control the passage of materials and the transit of white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. They achieve this through the formation of a semi-permeable barrier, in which permeability is regulated by tight junctions; complex structures that bring the cells together, sealing the space between them. This ensures a controlled, selective passage of nutrients, ions, and water from the bloodstream into the gut and vice versa, helping maintain homeostasis and overall health.
Gut endothelial cells also play a significant role in angiogenesis and serve as a critical regulator of the gut immune responses playing a modulative role in gut immune homeostasis and inflammatory responses. In addition, they generate nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, which helps in maintaining vascular tonus, preventing platelet and leukocyte adhesion, and decreasing smooth muscle proliferation. These multi-faceted roles make gut endothelial cells indispensable for the normal functioning of the gut and overall health.

These cells originate mainly from the mesoderm of the embryo, which forms connective tissues, muscle, and the circulatory and urinary systems. However, in adults, MSCs are found in multiple tissues, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, the umbilical cord, and dental tissues. 
The primary function of MSCs is to maintain and repair the tissues in which they are found. When damage occurs, the MSCs are able to migrate to the site of injury, where they aid in regenerating the damaged tissue by differentiating into the required cell type and by secreting growth factors that enhance tissue repair and reduce inflammation. Furthermore, MSCs can also act as immunomodulators, suppressing immune reactions and reducing inflammation, both locally and systemically.
Apart from their role in tissue maintenance and repair, MSCs are integral to the field of regenerative medicine and are being investigated for their therapeutic potential in various clinical settings. Owing to their multipotent nature, immunomodulatory activity, and the relative ease of isolation, these cells can be engineered and translated into therapies to treat a variety of diseases, including bone and cartilage defects, liver diseases, heart disorders, and autoimmune diseases, amongst others. They have also been used as vectors for anticancer agents and in cell and gene therapy applications.

The primary function of fat cells is to store energy in the form of fat, also known as triglycerides, for use during periods of caloric deficit. When we consume more calories than we use for energy, our bodies convert the excess energy into fat and store it in adipose tissue. 
Fat cells also play a role in regulating energy balance by secreting hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, which help to regulate appetite and metabolism. Fat calls have also been implicated in the development of obesity-related diseases, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. 
Finally, fat cells have been found to play a role in the immune system by secreting cytokines, which can either promote or inhibit inflammation depending on the type of cytokine produced.

Professional APCs include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Among these, dendritic cells are often considered the predominant APC as they have been demonstrated to activate naïve T cells. Macrophages and B cells also possess antigen-processing machinery and constitutively express MHC class II molecules. Dendritic cells and macrophages obtain antigens via phagocytosis of cells and cell debris, while B cells obtain antigens via the B cell receptor.
APCs are responsible for stimulating an appropriate immune response. Following antigen presentation (signal 1), they deliver costimulatory signals (signal 2) and secrete mediators such as cytokines (signal 3) that shape the subsequent immune response. APCs can also induce tolerogenic responses to self-antigens. APCs play important roles in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Compared to other cells in the lung epithelium, they are distinguished by their characteristic dome shape often marked by short, microvilli-like projections (but no cilia). Underneath their dome-like apex, they possess a large amount of cytoplasm containing numerous granules, and they have a round, centrally located nucleus. Their name 'club' was adopted to signify their appearance, which resembles a club or goblet.
Club cells perform various crucial roles in maintaining the homeostasis of the respiratory tract. Among their functions is the production and secretion of a variety of proteins, including the club cell secretory protein (CCSP), which plays a role in the immune response of the lungs, particularly, in mitigating inflammation. The secretion of surfactant proteins by these cells also contributes to reducing surface tension in the alveoli, thus facilitating the process of gas exchange. Besides helping to defend against oxidative stress and inflammatory response, surfactants also aid in preventing the air sacs in the lungs from collapsing.
Another vital role of club cells is their capacity to self-proliferate and differentiate into ciliated cells or basal cells, highlighting their regenerative capacity. This quality is especially critical for maintaining the integrity of the epithelial layer in the lung following any injury or inflammation, aiding the lung tissue to recover and restore its function. Furthermore, it is speculated that club cells might minimize the adverse impact of harmful substances in the air we inhale, thanks to a range of cytochrome P450 enzymes present in them. These enzymes assist in detoxifying harmful substances, a protective mechanism that helps preserve the overall health of the lungs.

The term \"goblet\" refers to their shape, which resembles a flask or goblet, specially at their apical end which is swollen due to the accumulation of secretory granules. 
The primary function of goblet cells is to to protect and lubricate the underlying tissues by secreting large quantities of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, which forms mucus when hydrated. In the respiratory tract, the mucus secreted by these cells traps dust, bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful particles in the inhaled air, preventing them from reaching the delicate tissues of the lungs. In the intestines, the goblet cells secrete mucus that acts as a protective barrier shielding the intestinal epithelium from dietary antigens, pathogens and prevents the intestinal epithelium from being eroded by the actions of the digestive enzymes and the abrasive action of passing food material.
Goblet cells are capable of rapidly altering their secretory output in response to stimuli. For example, irritants like smoke or dust can trigger an increased rate of mucus production, as the body attempts to flush out the harmful particles. Conversely, in conditions such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis, overactive goblet cells can create a thick accumulation of mucus that obstructs the airways and fosters bacterial growth. Lastly, goblet cells are not static, rather, they undergo a dynamic process known as goblet cell metaplasia-differentiation, wherein non-goblet cells in response to chronic injury or inflammation, can differentiate into goblet cells leading to an accumulation of these cells in the tissue, known as goblet cell hyperplasia.

Constituting less than 1% of the total population of intestinal cells, they are differentiated from a common intestinal cell progenitor, thus sharing lineage with absorptive and goblet cells of the intestines.
The distinct characteristic feature of an enteroendocrine cell is its inherent capacity to synthesize and secrete a plethora of gut hormones such as serotonin, somatostatin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin, secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, motilin, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Integrated within this complex network of signaling agents, these substances control various aspects of the digestive system. Each enteroendocrine cell has its unique combination of hormones to release, determined by its position along the intestinal tract. Intriguingly, these hormones not only modulate local gut function, including motility, absorption and secretion, but also potentiate distant actions on other systems such as endocrine, nervous and immune and play a role in the feeling of satiety.
The release of these hormones from enteroendocrine cells is a highly regulated and dynamic process. The cells are equipped with sensory receptors localized on its luminal side that respond to various stimuli, including changes in nutrient composition, chemical or mechanical changes in the gut lumen, or even signals arising from commensal microbiota. This sensory input stimulates a signaling cascade within the cell, culminating in the release of specific hormones into the interstitial fluid. These hormones then make their way into the bloodstream, acting on their respective target receptors to mediate their duties. The multifunctional characteristics of enteroendocrine cells make them crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis and the overall physiological well being of the body.

Chromaffin cells are also found in small clusters, known as paraganglia, in various locations throughout the body, including the sympathetic nervous system. They derive their name from their ability to stain a brownish-black color upon exposure to chromic salts, a feature made possible due to their high content of granules rich in catecholamines and catecholamine-related neurotransmitters.
The primary function of chromaffin cells is the synthesis and release of catecholamines, specifically epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). These neurotransmitters are vital stress hormones that, when released by the adrenal chromaffing cells into the bloodstream, prepare the body for the 'fight or flight' response. This response can enhance the body's performance in a dangerous situation by increasing heart rate, elevating blood sugar, and increasing blood flow to the muscles. The chromaffin cells in paraganglia are responsible for the local release of catecholamines and play a role in regulating blood pressure and other autonomic functions.
In addition to their role in stress response, chromaffin cells also contribute to the body's immune response. They secrete several peptides including antimicrobial peptides, and the discovery of LPS and cytokine receptors on chromaffin cells suggests that the adrenal medulla may participate in some aspects of the immune response.

Unique to mammals, Type B pancreatic cells are the predominant cell type in the pancreatic islets (50–80% of all islet endocrine cells) and play a crucial role in the body's metabolic regulation and glucose homeostasis. 
The primary function of type B pancreatic cells is the production, storage, and release of insulin, accounting for almost all insulin production in the human body: each cell contains about 20 pg insulin. Insulin has a critical function in regulating blood sugar levels: whenever glucose levels in the blood are high, such as after a meal, type B pancreatic cells secrete insulin to promote glucose uptake into cells, transforming it into usable energy or storing it for later use. Additionally, insulin also inhibits glucose production by the liver, therefore lowering blood glucose levels.
Impaired function of the type B cells is associated with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, metabolic diseases characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. In type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune response leads to the attack of the body’s own type B cells, resulting in the insufficient production and secretion of insulin. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance occurs, and type B cells are unable to compensate by producing more insulin.

Their primary role involves the synthesis, storage, and secretion of the peptide hormone glucagon, which is critical in energy regulation throughout the body. 
In response to a decrease in blood glucose levels, the pancreatic A cells are stimulated to secrete glucagon into the bloodstream. Glucagon acts on its target cells, mainly in the liver, to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis processes, thereby increasing blood glucose levels back to normal. In this way, pancreatic A cells play an integral role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing hypoglycemia.

The primary function of Leydig cells is the production of androgens, the male sex hormones, the most notable of which is testosterone. Leydig cells synthesize testosterone from cholesterol through a series of enzymatic reactions. The production and release of testosterone are mainly regulated by the luteinizing hormone (LH) released by the anterior pituitary gland. In response to LH, Leydig cells convert cholesterol into testosterone, which then plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of primary and secondary male sexual characteristics. These include the formation and maturation of male reproductive organs, onset of spermatogenesis, and the presentation of male secondary sexual traits such as the deepening of the voice, growth of facial hair, development of muscles, and a broadening of shoulders.
Apart from testosterone production, Leydig cells also secrete insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3) that is essential for testicular descent during embryonic development in males. Dysregulation or loss of Leydig cells can lead to numerous conditions like testosterone deficiency, infertility, and certain forms of testicular cancer. Although not typical, Leydig cells can regenerate if they are damaged, ensuring the continuous production of testosterone and maintaining male reproductive health. They provide an excellent model to study cell differentiation and hormone regulation, thereby enhancing our understanding of reproductive biology and associated disorders.

Dimensions of mature hepatocytes typically range from 20 to 30 μm in humans, but size may vary depending on their location within the liver lobule. Hepatocytes are characterized by high biosynthetic, enzymatic, and endocytic activity. They contain abundant mitochondria, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and a large nucleus that is often binucleate. 
The liver consists of three zones - the periportal Zone 1, midzone 2, and pericentral Zone 3 - which have differential nutrient and oxygen status, and damage susceptibility; hepatocytes in the different zones show signifcant functional heterogeneity ('hepatocyte functional zonation'). Hepatocytes are involved in a multitude of critical functions including the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, the synthesis of serum proteins (e.g., albumin, transferrin, and lipoproteins), the detoxification and excretion of endogenous and exogenous substances, the storage of vitamins and minerals, and the production and secretion of bile. 
Heterocytes demonstrate a remarkable regenerative capacity, which enables the liver to recover from injury and loss of tissue mass. Notably, hepatocytes perform biotransformation with both phase I and phase II enzymes, which modify drugs, xenobiotics, and various substances for elimination from the body. Phase I enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, catalyze both oxidative and reductive reactions of many xenobiotics; many of the products of phase I enzymes are substrates for the phase II enzymes, which catalyze conjugation reactions. 
Alterations in hepatocyte function have significant implications for overall human health and disease. Certain conditions, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, can profoundly affect hepatocyte structure and function, thereby disrupting the liver's ability to perform its vital roles within the body. As the primary site for drug metabolism, changes in hepatocyte function can also impact the effectiveness and toxicity of pharmaceuticals. The regenerative ability of hepatocytes makes them valuable cells for liver regenerative medicine and bioartificial liver support systems, and their study has provided significant insights into liver biology and disease.

They carry out a crucial role in many biological processes, including tissue repair and fibrosis, wound contraction, and organogenesis. Though similar to fibroblasts, myofibroblasts can be differentiated by their unique morphological features and the presence of specialized protein bundles called stress fibers.
Myofibroblasts originate from several cell types based on the physiological condition or the injury context, including local fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells, shedding light onto their plasticity. Upon tissue injury or wound creation, myofibroblasts activate and undergo a transformation process whereby they develop contractile features. They express a type of protein called alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), allowing them to contract and aid in wound closure. These cells also produce extracellular matrix (ECM) components, primarily collagen, to support and provide structural integrity to the healing tissue.
However, while myofibroblasts play a critical role in normal wound healing, their function can be detrimental in certain pathological conditions. For instance, in chronic diseases such as fibrosis or scarring, the extended presence or overactivity of myofibroblasts can lead to the excessive production of ECM and fibrous tissues, leading to hardened, rigid tissues and organ dysfunction.

These elongated, multi-nucleated cells convert ATP into mechanical energ and are key for voluntary movement and posture. They also are responsible for maintaining body temperature, storing nutrients, and stabilizing joints.
Skeletal muscle cells organize themselves tightly into bundles to form muscle fibers. Embedded within each of these cells are thousands of myofibrils, which are made up of the contractile proteins, actin (the thin filament), and myosin (the thick filament). Contraction of a skeletal muscle cell occurs when these myofibrils shorten, a process driven by the sliding of actin and myosin filaments over each other in a mechanism famously known as the sliding filament theory.
Additionally, skeletal muscle cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity, which allows for their adaptation in response to alterations in functional demands or damages. They have an innate regenerative capacity due to the presence of satellite cells—quiescent muscle stem cells that reside within the muscle fibers. Upon muscle injury, these satellite cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into new muscle cells, thereby contributing to the repair and growth of injured skeletal muscle. With this, skeletal muscle cells serve not only a pivotal biomechanical function but also possess a great capacity for self-healing and regeneration.

These cells are predominantly found in the postural muscles of the body, such as those in the back and lower limbs. 
A defining characteristic of slow muscle cells is their significant resistance to fatigue. This is largely due to their efficient oxidative metabolism, which allows them to continuously contract over extended periods without succumbing to fatigue. This extraordinary endurance is facilitated by a high concentration of mitochondria, which enables the efficient use of oxygen for energy production, and capillaries, which supplies the necessary oxygen and nutrients. Additionally, these cells have an abundant supply of myoglobin, a protein that stores and transports oxygen within the muscle cell, further supporting their aerobic metabolism.
The primary role of slow muscle cells in the human body is to provide sustained, low-intensity contractions over a prolonged period. They are responsible for maintaining posture and providing stability, rather than delivering short, powerful bursts of activity. They play a pivotal role in supporting various physical activities such as standing, walking, or any form of exercise that requires endurance over speed.

The designation \"fast\" refers to their speed of contraction in response to neural stimuli, which is significantly quicker when compared to other muscle cell types such as slow-twitch or type I muscle fibers.
The primary function of fast muscle cells revolves around their role in anaerobic metabolism, which provides the energy needed for short, forceful bursts of power. They contain a high concentration of glycolytic enzymes that facilitate this process, leading to a swift break down of glucose to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency in biological systems. On the downside, the byproduct of this very rapid, anaerobic metabolic process is lactic acid, which can build up and cause muscle fatigue. 
Fast muscle cells can be further classified into two subtypes based on their metabolic characteristics: type IIa and type IIb/x. Type IIa cells, also known as fast oxidative-glycolytic fibers, possess a good oxygen supply and can function in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, exhibiting moderate resistance to fatigue. On the other hand, type IIb/x cells, also known as fast glycolytic fibers, primarily rely on anaerobic metabolism and tire out a lot quicker. Both these subtypes can adapt to changing demands due to exercise and conditioning, highlighting the plasticity that is a key characteristic of these versatile muscle cells.

Smooth muscle cells play a vital role in many physiological processes due to their unique functionality. They can contract and relax in a slow, sustained, and controlled manner to help modulate the size and shape of the lumens of the organs they surround. For example, in the digestive system, coordinated contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells propels food along the gastrointestinal tract - a process known as peristalsis. In the blood vessels, the smooth muscle cells, by contracting or relaxing, either constrict or dilate the vessels, which in turn, help regulate blood flow and pressure.
On a cellular level, smooth muscle cells possess a single, centrally located nucleus and contain an arranged network of actin and myosin filaments, which are the proteins responsible for muscle contraction. Unlike their counterparts in skeletal or cardiac muscles, these cells lack specific contact points for these filaments, hence the lack of visible striations. Furthermore, the contraction of smooth muscle cells is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, adding an additional layer of complex regulation to these highly specialized cells.

These cells are called photoreceptor cells because they are light-sensitive, enabling vision in conditions ranging from extremely dim to very bright light. There are two main types of photoreceptor cells in the human eye: rods, which are highly sensitive to light and allow for vision in low-light conditions, and cones, which are responsible for color vision and function best in bright light.
The photoreceptor cells function by absorbing light rays and converting them into electrical signals. These signals are then sent to the brain via the optic nerve and are interpreted as visual images. This process begins when the photopigment (a light-sensitive compound) found in photoreceptor cells absorbs light, which triggers a chemical reaction. This reaction leads to changes in the photopigment's configuration and, consequently, alters its electrical properties. This change initiates a signal that is transmitted through the cell and onwards to connecting neurons.
Furthermore, photoreceptor cells exhibit a unique and highly specialized structure that reflects their function. Rods, named because of their elongated, rod-shaped structure, consist of an outer segment filled with disks containing rhodopsin, the photopigment responsible for detecting light. Cones, on the other hand, are more conical and have three different types of photopigments, each one sensitive to a different range of wavelengths, allowing for the perception of color. Given the importance of photoreceptor cells in vision, damage or degeneration to these cells can lead to vision impairment or blindness, highlighting their key role in visual perception.

They originate from the megakaryocytes in the bone marrow via a process called thrombopoiesis. Platelets are central to hemostasis, a process that prevents bleeding from broken or damaged blood vessels and facilitates wound healing. In their resting state, platelets are inactive but become quickly activated when an injury occurs.
Platelets function in the initiation and regulation of coagulation or clotting, which is a complex process involving several bioactive molecules. When a blood vessel is injured, the inner lining of the vessel, the endothelium, gets disrupted, exposing the underlying tissue matrix. This leads to platelet activation and adhesion to the injury site, initiating the clotting cascade. Platelets release granules packed with clotting factors, proteins, enzymes, and more platelets, which further propagates the clotting process. When activated, platelets also change their shape from discoid to a spherical form with protruding pseudopods that enables them to adhere more readily to the site of injury and mesh with one another to form a 'platelet plug'. 
Additionally, platelets serve other physiological roles. They release growth factors enhancing tissue regeneration and wound healing. They also play a significant role in inflammation, innate immunity, and antimicrobial host defense, as they interact with leukocytes and may sequester microbes. Platelets are involved in maintaining the integrity of the blood vessels and angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Proper functioning of platelets is critical for maintaining homeostasis, while dysregulation can lead to conditions such as thrombosis or bleeding disorders.

Phagocytes circulate throughout the body, patrolling and guarding against the invasion of pathogens. They are one among many types of cells that originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.
Upon detection of an invading microorganism, phagocytes are mobilized by inflammatory mediators (such as bacterial proteins or complement proteins) to the infection site. They recognize surface molecules, specifically antigens, on harmful bacteria or other foreign substances with the help of opsonins, which are proteins that bind to the pathogen and make them more susceptible to phagocytosis. The process of phagocytosis involves the extension of the phagocyte's membrane around the microorganism, completely enclosing it within a microbicidal vacuole, the phagolysosome, which contains various microbicidal chemicals and digestive enzymes such as cathepsins, proteases, lysozymes, and lipases that may be employed to degrade the pathogen.
Phagocytes are predominantly neutrophils or monocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of phagocyte and are usually the first to arrive at the site of infection. Monocytes are derived from the bone marrow and can circulate to tissues and mature into local macrophages. Macrophages arrive later at sites of infection and are longer-lived than neutrophils. The process of phagocytosis must be tightly regulated to avoid host tissue damage.

These cells are part of the outermost layer of the skin, called the epidermis, and are also found lining surfaces of the body that are subjected to physical or chemical wear and tear, such as the mouth, esophagus, and vagina. The primary role of these cells is to create a barrier that protects underlying tissues from dehydration, abrasion, and infection.
The stratified squamous epithelium is able to provide a strong, force-resistant barrier due to the stratified arrangement of the cells; it consists primarily of keratinocytes in various stages of differentiation: The basal layer contains cells that continuously divide and push older cells towards the surface. As the cells move up through the layers, they gradually flatten and become filled with a protein called keratin. In high-abrasion areas like the skin, the outer layers of these cells can become so filled with keratin that they die (they become 'keratinized'), providing an even more robust barrier; eventually, they are shed off in a process known as desquamation.
In addition to forming a protective barrier, stratified squamous epithelial cells also play a part in the immune response. They can recognize pathogens, and in response, release chemical signals that attract immune cells to the site of potential infection. Moreover, they also carry out a variety of interactions with the immune system to ensure that invading pathogens cannot penetrate into deeper layers of the body.

They are integral to the complex process of vision, as they are directly involved in converting light into electrical signals. This process is known as phototransduction. There are two primary classes of photoreceptor cells; rods, which function mainly in dim light and provide black-and-white vision, and cones, which function in brighter light and allow for the perception of color.
Rods and cones carry out their roles through sophisticated biochemical reactions. The main component of these reactions is a protein called opsin, which binds to a small molecule known as retinal. In the presence of light, retinal changes its shape, leading to a series of chemical reactions that result in changes to the cell’s electrical potential, thus creating an electrical signal that travels to the optic nerve. Rod cells possess only one kind of opsin, called rhodopsin, which only allows them to distinguish between light and dark. Conversely, cone cells have three types of opsins, allowing for the differentiation of various colors.
The spatial distribution of these cell types throughout the retina also contributes to their function. Rod cells are more numerous and are distributed more at the periphery of the retina, contributing to peripheral and night vision. On the other hand, cone cells are concentrated in the macula, a tiny central region in the retina, and with the highest density in the fovea, a small pit in the macula. This distribution of cones lies at the base of fine detail and color vision in the central visual field. In summary, eye photoreceptor cells carry out the primary function of transforming light into visual signals, a role that is crucial for the overall process of vision.

These cells are haploid, containing half the genome or only one set of chromosomes, which is a contrast to the diploid state (two sets of chromosomes) found in most cells in a multicellular organism. This reduction in genetic material is crucial since it allows for the re-establishment of the diploid number of chromosomes when two gametes merge to form a diploid zygote during fertilization.
There are two major types of gametes in animals: sperm cells in males and egg (or ova) in females. These gametes contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the offspring but are morphologically and functionally distinct. Sperm cells (or spermatozoa) are characterized by their motility, small size, and large quantities; they are produced continuously in vast numbers through a process called spermatogenesis in the male gonads or testes. Female gametes are much larger, fewer in numbers, and are not motile; they undergo a development process known as oogenesis, which takes place within the ovaries. The egg also contributes most of the cytoplasm and organelles (including mitochondria) to the zygote that are required for initial cell division stages after fertilization.
Gametes have a primary role in sexual reproduction and genetic variation, which aids in evolution. The formation of gametes involves a special type of cell division called meiosis that introduces genetic diversity via the process of recombination and independent assortment. Following the fusion of male and female gametes, the combination of paternal and maternal genetic material in the zygote allows for genetic recombination, which is a fundamental source of genetic variation and, thus, evolution. Therefore, gametes not only are critical to the inception of new individuals but also contribute to species survival and evolution.

They derive their name from the predominantly smooth appearance under microscopic examination, as opposed to the striated appearance of cardiac and skeletal muscles.  
A principal function of VSMCs is to regulate vascular tone, which directly dictates blood pressure and blood flow distribution across various body parts. This is achieved through coordinated contraction and relaxation of the muscles in response to a variety of extracellular signals. When a blood vessel is exposed to stimuli like pressure or injury, VSMCs contract, resulting in vasoconstriction and ultimately, an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, in response to vasodilators, these cells relax, leading to vasodilation and a consequent decrease in blood pressure.
VSMCs are also involved in vascular remodeling, a process where blood vessels adapt their structure to long-term changes in hemodynamic conditions or disease states. In diseases like atherosclerosis and hypertension, an aberrant proliferative and synthetic phenotype of VSMCs contributes to the formation of plaques, leading to vessel hardening or even occlusion. Recent research has further implicated these cells in immune responses, recognizing their function in leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, factors that are largely instrumental in vascular pathologies.

The thickness and stratification of the epidermis vary with its location in the body, depending on the specific demand for protective function.
One notable characteristic of epidermal cells is their continuous cycle of renewal. The cells are produced in the deepest layer of the epidermis, known as the basal or germinative layer, where they undergo cell division. As new cells form, they gradually push the older cells towards the skin surface. While ascending, these cells undergo a process known as keratinization, where they become filled with keratin, a protein that provides strength and rigidity. By the time they reach the surface, they are essentially dead and filled with keratin, forming a tough, resistant layer that is regularly shed and replaced by newer cells beneath.

Furthermore, these ganglion interneurons have significant roles in the formulation and execution of motor reflexes and serve as integral components of reflex arcs. They also participate in the modulation and filtration of relevant sensory information, ensuring that signals reaching the late-stage processing units (like the brain) are refined and critical to the organism's survival.

The male gamete is distinguished by its morphology, notably its elongated shape which is geared towards locomotion. One of the primary characteristics of a male gamete is its flagellum, or tail, which propels the cell towards the female gamete. It additionally contains an elongated head region housing the nucleus, where the genetic material is stored. The anterior section of the head, the acrosome, releases enzymes essential for penetrating the protective layers of the ovum during the fertilization process.
The function of male gametes does not cease upon fertilization. In addition to delivering the paternal set of chromosomes, fusion of the sperm cell with the ovum causes an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ which then activates the female egg cell to undergo the so-called cortical reaction during which the egg’s zona pellucida is changed so fusion with additional sperm is prevented. The Ca2+ signal also initiates the development of the zygote and eventual formation of an embryo. Male gametes also contribute towards forming the placenta, which supplies nutrients and removes waste products during gestation.

In addition, FDCs secrete various cytokines and chemokines that direct immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation.
FDCs are unique among immune cells in that they do not originate from hematopoietic stem cells, but rather from stromal cells in the lymphoid tissues. They are characterized by their distinctive shape, with long, branching processes that form a network within the follicle. FDCs are also distinguished by the presence of complement receptors, Fc receptors, and other molecules that enable them to capture and present antigens to B-cells.
Because of their important role in antigen presentation and immune regulation, FDCs have been studied extensively in the context of infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer.

Importantly, white fat cells are crucial for the proper functioning of numerous physiological processes including appetite regulation, inflammatory response, and immunity. They are also known to secrete various hormones and cytokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, which are instrumental in regulating metabolic activities and maintaining overall metabolic homeostasis. Dysregulation of these cells, along with an accumulation of excess white fat, has been linked to several health issues including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

These cells are rich in mitochondria, which lends them their characteristic brown colouring. Mitochondria are crucial to the brown fat cell's function since they contain an integral protein called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). This protein permits protons to leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane, disrupting the usual pathway of ATP production. Instead of generating ATP, the energy derived from glucose and fatty acids is dissipated as heat. This unique function makes brown fat cells an important biological tool for regulating body temperature, especially in infants and hibernating animals.
While historically believed to be primarily relevant in newborns, recent findings highlight a role of brown fat cells in adults as well. They provide significant health benefits by metabolising excess glucose in the body and burning unwanted fat, and thereby raising the possibilities of using brown fat cells therapeutically for conditions like obesity or diabetes. Furthermore, stimulation of brown fat activity in adults is linked with improved overall metabolic health and lower risk of metabolic syndrome.

These cells play a vital role in establishing and maximizing the capability of the immune system to combat infections. Like all T lymphocytes, CD4+ helper T cells are uniquely characterized by the expression of a T-cell receptor (TCR) complex on their cell surface. The subset of CD4+ cells express the CD4 glycoprotein on their cell surface that serves as a co-receptor for the T-cell receptor. The CD4 co-receptor enables these cells to interact with antigen-presenting cells and perform their influential role in adaptive immune response.
CD4+ helper T cells are primarily responsible for assisting other cells in the immunological processes. This involves recognition, interaction, and processing of antigens. Once an antigen-presenting cell presents a foreign antigen such as peptides derived from pathogens or transformed cells to the CD4+ helper T cell, it becomes activated, proliferates, and differentiates into subtypes such as Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg, each with a specific role in the immune response. Th1 cells produces various cytokines. including IFN‐γ, IL-2 and TNF-β, and aid cell-mediated immune responses against intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL13 and assist in antibody-mediated immune responses. 
Th17 cells release IL-17 and convey protective immunity against extracellular bacteria and fungi as well as contributing to inflammation and autoimmunity, while Treg cells are immunosuppressive cells and maintain immune homeostasis and provide tolerance to self-antigens. Finally, follicular T helper (Tfh) cells are thought to help B cells build up antibody responses by assisting germinal center formation, affinity maturation, and possibly immunoglobulin class switch recombination 
In addition to their critical role in immune response, CD4+ helper T cells are notably the main target of HIV infection, where the virus depletes the number of these cells, resulting in the deterioration of the immune system, characterized in the progression to AIDS. Thus, the presence and functionality of CD4+ helper T cells are not only necessary for a healthy immune response but also crucial in the context of immunodeficiency diseases.

Known for their inhibitory nature, these neurons form connections mainly within the same region of the brain or spinal cord where they are located. This localization allows them to impact the activities of nearby excitatory neurons by means of inhibitory networks to inhibit or reduce the likelihood of the firing of these excitatory neurons.
Functionally, Inhibitory Interneurons serve as primary regulators and modulators of the output of nerve cells, orchestrating a balance between excitatory and inhibitory activities in neural networks. It is through their characteristic release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine, that they manage to suppress postsynaptic potentials, preventing or reducing the propagation of action potentials. This regulation is not only essential for maintaining equilibrium within the nervous system, but also helps prevent conditions that arise from excessive neuronal activities, such as epilepsy.
Inhibitory Interneurons, while relatively small in number compared to their excitatory counterparts, exhibit considerable diversity in their structure, function, and neurochemical expression. They are broadly categorized into multiple subtypes, each with its unique influence on neural circuit behavior and role in different behaviors or cognitive processes. For instance, certain subtypes are involved with timing and synchrony of neural activity, while others participate in contrast enhancement in sensory processing or in isolating specific activity patterns.

Named for their grainy appearance, they are situated in the follicular epithelium, lining the inner part of the follicle and directly surrounding the oocyte. These cells stand as an integral part of the ovarian structure and function.
One of the primary roles of granulosa cells is to aid in the production and secretion of sex hormones, particularly estrogen. They achieve this by working in tandem with theca cells, which stay attached to the external layer of the follicle. Theca cells produce androstenedione (a type of androgen) which granulosa cells then convert into estradiol, a form of estrogen, with the help of the enzyme aromatase. Moreover, granulosa cells participate in luteinization, transforming into luteal granulosa cells as a response to the luteinizing hormone during ovulation. This allows the formation of the corpus luteum, responsible for the secretion of progesterone necessary to maintain pregnancy.
Granulosa cells also play a significant role in follicular development and oocyte maturation, involving close communication with the contained oocyte. They support the oocyte through the provision of nutrients and growth factors, control its meiotic cycle and ensure it is appropriately oriented and instructed for impending ovulation. Furthermore, granulosa cells contribute to the formation of the zona pellucida and the follicular fluid, providing an optimal environment for the oocyte's growth and maturation. These cells, thus, perform multiple vital roles, underscoring their importance in fertility and reproductive health.

In the gastrointestinal tract, somatostatin slows down digestion. It reduces gastric acid secretion and slows down the rate of gastric emptying, thereby prolonging and controling the digestive p. Functionally, these effects are aimed at sustaining nutrient absorption to optimize energy extraction from consumed food.
In the pancreas, D cells maintain a vital role in endocrine regulation. D cells in the pancreatic islands secrete somatostatin to inhibit the release of both insulin and glucagon from type A cells and B cells, glucoregulatory hormones that control blood sugar levels. Hence, D cells contribute considerably to the homeostasis of the body's metabolic processes. It is also noteworthy that dysfunctional D cells or irregular somatostatin signaling has been associated with certain pathologies such as neuroendocrine tumors and gastric ulcers.

Theca interna cells are highly vascularized and specialized to produce androgens, specifically androstenedione, a precursor to estradiol. When the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates granulosa cells to produce aromatase, this enzyme then converts the androgens into estrogens. Consequently, the hormonal interaction between theca interna cells and granulosa cells supports the production of estrogen necessary for the reproductive cycle. 
Theca externa cells, on the other hand, are mechanically supportive cells. They form an outer protective layer around the follicle. While they do not directly influence hormone production, they play an essential role in structural integrity and act in concert with the granulosa and theca interna cells during the rupture of the mature ovarian follicle, releasing the egg for potential fertilization. Simultaneously, these cells participate in the formation of the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone to prepare the uterus for potential implantation.

They have also been found in smaller numbers in the colonic crypts and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Paneth cells are characterized by large acidophilic granules, which take up most of the cytoplasmic volume, causing the nucleus to be pushed toward the base of the cell.
Paneth cells function as a part of the innate immune system. The large granules inside the cells are filled with antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and lysozymes. Upon bacterial intrusion or cellular signaling indicating a potential infection, Paneth cells release the granules containing the antimicrobial substances into the crypt lumen, effectively serving as the first line of defense against bacterial invasion within the gastrointestinal tract. In essence, Paneth cells serve as guardians, protecting the intestinal stem cells from harmful pathogens that may disturb the gut ecosystem.
In addition to their primary role in immunity, Paneth cells are also crucial for supporting the stem cell niche in the intestinal crypts. They are located adjacent to Lgr5+ stem cells and secrete various growth factors such as EGF, TGF-alpha, Wnt3, and Notch ligand Dll4. These factors regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of these stem cells, which continuously replenish the intestinal epithelium. Consequently, any abnormality or dysfunction in Paneth cells could lead to a disturbance in gut homeostasis, possibly resulting in various illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease.

All T lymphocytes are uniquely characterized by the expression of a T-cell receptor (TCR) complex on their cell surface. Th2 cells express the CD4 co-receptor which enables the T-cell receptor to engage with antigen-presenting cells and perform their influential role in adaptive immune response.
Th2 cells differentiate from naïve CD4+  T cells following TCR ligation and specific cytokine signaling. Th2 cell development and stabilization requires the master regulatory transcription factor GATA-3. Furthermore, IL-4-mediated activation of STAT6 is thought to play an important role in Th2 cell differentiation. 
The primary function of Th2 cells is to coordinate the immune response against extracellular pathogens, particularly parasitic helminths. They achieve this primarily through the secretion of their signature cytokines – the interleukins IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. For instance, IL-4 promotes the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells that produce immunoglobulin E (IgE), a class of antibodies that mediate the immune response to parasites and are involved in allergic reactions. IL-5 promotes the activation and survival of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that is effective against certain parasites. IL-13 works alongside IL-4 but also influences mucus production in the respiratory tract, an important defense mechanism against parasites.
Despite their critical roles in host defense, an overactive Th2 response can also lead to pathological outcomes such as allergy and asthma. These health issues are typically characterized by excessive IgE production, eosinophilic inflammation, and mucus hypersecretion, all hallmarks of a Th2 response. In these instances, the immune system reacts excessively to normally harmless substances like pollen, dust mites, or certain foods, with the Th2 cells driving this overreaction. As such, understanding the precise pathways and mechanisms through which Th2 cells operate not only provides insight into protective immune responses but also potential therapeutic targets for treating allergies and other related conditions.

The term ‘megakaryocyte’ is derived from the Greek 'mega', meaning great, and 'karyon', referring to the nucleus. Megakaryocytes are characterized by their large size, typically with a diameter of 50-100 µm in humans, and the presence of a multilobulated nucleus; they are the largest hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow but also the rarest cells. 
The primary function of a megakaryocyte is the production of platelets, also known as thrombocytes. Platelets are small, anucleate cell fragments that play a crucial role in the process of hemostasis, the arrest of blood loss from a damaged blood vessel. The process begins when the megakaryocyte extends long, branching processes called proplatelets, into the sinusoidal blood vessels present in the bone marrow. These proplatelets then fragment into the discoid structures recognized as platelets. Each megakaryocyte can produce thousands of platelets during its lifespan. 
Apart from platelet production, megakaryocytes are involved in several other functions. They express immune-sensing receptors such as Fc-γ receptor and Toll-like receptors and produce factors such as platelet factor 4 and platelet-derived growth factor that can stimulate the immune system. Also, in certain pathological conditions, megakaryocytes release TGF-β and PDGF and contribute to bone marrow fibrosis, a condition characterized by excessive accumulation of fibrous tissue in the bone marrow leading to anemia. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of megakaryocytes in regulating hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell production. They can influence the bone marrow microenvironment and control the behavior of hematopoietic stem cells, the progenitors of all types of blood cells.

During monocytopoiesis, promonocytes form after monoblasts differentiate, and precede the development of monocytes and macrophages, which play an integral role in the immune system.
Promonocytes are large, often round cells with a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. Their cytoplasm is laden with small azurophilic granules, and they are similar in appearance to myelocytes and metamyelocytes. 
The maturation into monocytes is the key function of promonocytes. Once matured, they navigate their way to the bloodstream and their primary role comes into effect. Monocytes circulate in the blood for a few days before migrating to tissues to become either macrophages or dendritic cells. These cells then proceed to ingest pathogens like bacteria and viruses, helping to keep the body healthy. Thus, promonocytes play a central role in the immune system by paving the way for the development of cells that fight off toxins and attacks.
Beyond their immune response role through differentiation, promonocytes may participate in processes such as wound healing and inflammation regulation. Defects or disruptions in promonocyte function have been linked to health disorders, including monocytic-lineage leukemias such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), although it is worth noting that morphologic distinction between promonocytes and other monocytic cells of various differentiation levels is difficult.

They function by converting light into signals that can lead to a visual perception. These cells are less sensitive to light compared to rod cells, but they play a crucial role in our vision system for their ability to perceive color and provide sharp visual acuity. They are responsible for our daylight and color vision, enabling an individual to perceive fine detail and rapid changes in light levels.
Cone cells are specialized and named based on the absorption spectra of the visual pigments they contain, giving rise to three types of cone cells: short-wavelength S-cones (blue cones), middle-wavelength M-cones (green cones), and long-wavelength L-cones (red cones). The distribution of these cones across the retina differs, with greater densities at the central fovea region, contributing to why our central vision is so sharp and color-detailed compared to peripheral vision.
The outer segments of retinal cone cells house the photopigments that absorb light and initiate the process of phototransduction, a biochemical event by which the light signal is transformed into an electrical signal. When a cone cell is stimulated by light, an electrochemical reaction triggers nerve impulses, which are then transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve. There, these impulses are processed into the images that we see. Each type of cone responds to different wavelengths of light, enabling us to perceive a spectrum of color. By working in conjunction with rod cells, which are adapted for low-light vision scenarios, the cone cells provide us with a comprehensive and adaptable vision system.

Corneal epithelial cells also have a unique and highly organized cytoskeleton that confers mechanical integrity and limits the penetration of foreign substances. Additionally, corneal epithelial cells secrete a variety of proteins and lipids that help to maintain the hydration and clarity of the cornea. These include mucins, which form a lubricating layer that facilitates blinking and limits dryness, and crystallins, which appear to protect against UV- and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.
Dysfunction of corneal epithelial cells due to infections, inflammation, or injury can lead to corneal opacity, scarring, and impaired vision.

Upon muscle injury or trauma, these normally quiescent cells activate, proliferate, and differentiate into myoblasts. These myoblasts subsequently mature and fuse to form myotubes, which ultimately help in the repair and rebuilding of muscle fibers. This response is an integral part of the skeletal muscle's ability to recover from injury and adapt to enhanced or changing physical demands, thereby maintaining and improving muscle function.
Furthermore, SMSCs also contribute to hypertrophic muscle growth due to resistance exercise and endurance training, with the notable feature of their multi-nucleated nature resulting from the fusion of differentiated myoblasts. The additional nuclei support enhanced protein synthesis, thus allowing the muscle fibers to grow and strengthen in response to exercise. In aging and in diseases, the number or functionality of these cells can decrease, leading to impaired muscle regeneration and progressive muscle weakness.

The primary characteristic of these neurons is a large apical dendrite that ascends toward the cortical surface, numerous basal dendrites, and a single axon. These neurons are found within parts of the brain including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala, playing a critical role in cortex communication, cognitive function, and the relay of information within the brain's neural network.
Functional roles of pyramidal neurons depend largely on their localization. However, all types of these neurons serve as principal cells within the grey matter of the brain, transmitting signals over long distances. Primarily, pyramidal cells function as excitatory neurons; they disseminate action potential outputs to other neurons which they are connected to across the synapse. In the cerebral cortex, pyramidal neurons are paramount for sensory perception and motor command, while those located in the hippocampus involve in memory and learning processes.
Firing properties of these neurons such as regular spiking and bursting are notable features thought to play a role in synaptic plasticity and signaling. Together, their unique anatomical structure and intricate connectivity underpin their critical function in brain neural networks, significantly contributing to human cognitive abilities. In addition, abnormalities in pyramidal neurons have been linked to a range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, emphasizing their importance in maintaining healthy neural function.

Their primary function is to detect and convert light into electrochemical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via nerve impulses. Compared to other types of photoreceptor cells, namely retinal cone cells, rod cells are more sensitive to light, and thus play a crucial role in night and peripheral vision.
Rod cells are named for their long, cylindrical shape, which is distinct from the cone-like shape of retinal cone cells. The structure of a rod cell is complex, with different sections responsible for various aspects of its function. The outer segment contains densely packed, light-sensitive membrane discs filled with a pigment called rhodopsin. When light hits rhodopsin, it prompts a chemical reaction that leads to the generation of electrochemical signals. These signals are processed in the cell's inner segment, which contains the cell's primary organelles, including the nucleus and mitochondria, and transmitted through the cell's synaptic terminal to the secondary neurons in the retina.
Rod cells are distributed across the majority of the retina, with the highest density found in the peripheral edges. This distribution, coupled with their high sensitivity to light, explains why rod cells contribute significantly to peripheral and low-light vision. However, they do not pick up color and have low spatial acuity, which means that while rod cells can detect the presence of light and movement, the finer details and colors of an image are processed mainly by cone cells. Together, rod cells and cone cells work in concert to enable a wide range of visual capabilities, making vision a complex and intricate biological process.

In the salivary glands, acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes as well as other substances such as mucus and water. These secretions service the initial stages of the digestive process, preparing the consumed food for onward digestion in the stomach and intestines by lubricating and partially breaking it down. 
In the pancreas, acinar cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting a significant amount of digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and amylase. These enzymes are stored in zymogen granules inside the acinar cells until they are dispatched into the small intestine. Once within the small intestine, they break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into substances that can be absorbed. This is vital to the effective and efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume. 
Acinar cells have high protein synthesis rates and are susceptible to accumulation of misfolded proteins; the subsequential induction of ER stress is thought to be involved in the development of pancreatitis, a serious inflammatory disease of the exocrine pancreas.

These support cells contribute to maintaining the homeostasis and structural integrity of the retina. Mueller cells span the entire thickness of the retina, thus representing the only cell type that traverses all layers.
Mueller cells play a crucial role in maintaining the metabolic environment of retinal neurons and participating in the visual signal transduction. They have a unique organization and possess a wide range of processes, giving them direct contact with virtually every type of cell in the retina—including photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells. These cells actively uptake and recycle neurotransmitters, modulate chemical levels within the extracellular space, and are involved in potassium siphoning, thus supporting neuronal signaling. Due to these functions, they play a vital role in maintaining the physiological and functional stability of the retina.
Moreover, Mueller cells are also responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the retina. They serve as the retinal framework by providing structural support to neurons and blood vessels. They contribute to the formation and maintenance of the inner limiting membrane, comprising their end-feet at the vitreous surface. Additionally, they play an essential role during injury or disease, exhibiting reactive gliosis – a process where these cells undergo morphological and functional changes to aid in repair and protection from further damage. While their protective role is important, it's also worth noting that overactivation of Mueller cells may result in retinal scarring or degeneration, reinforcing their complex and delicate role in retinal health and disease.

The primary function of Bergmann glial cells is to support and nourish the adjacent neuronal cells, especially the Purkinje cells. Their strategic arrangements around synapses or nerve junctions also indicate their role in facilitating communication between neurons and in modulating synaptic plasticity. The glial cells remove excess neurotransmitters from the synaptic clefts and thus help maintain homeostasis. An additional important role of Bergmann glia is in the guided migration of granule cells during cerebellar development. This guidance is critical for the proper formation and arrangement of the cerebellar circuitry.
In addition to these roles, recent studies have revealed a vital function of Bergmann glial cells in maintaining the overall health and functioning of the cerebellum. In instances of cerebellar injury or disease, these cells respond proactively and change their morphology and activity, a process known as reactive gliosis. This response seems to protect and restore the neural circuits. However, aberrant activation of Bergmann glial cells has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and disorders, such as spinocerebellar ataxia, underscoring their significance in the pathobiology of the nervous system.

They play an essential role in kidney function, particularly in the filtration selectivity of the glomerulus. Each podocyte is characterized by a unique architecture with a large cell body, ‘major processes’ extending outwardly from the cell body and ‘foot processes’, also known as pedicels, which surround. the glomerular capillary loops
Podocytes represent the last barrier of the glomerular filtration membrane in the kidney. This barrier prevents the leakage of plasma proteins from the blood into the urine, hence maintaining protein homeostasis in the body. The foot processes of the podocytes interdigitate with those from neighboring cells. The cell-cell junctions between the foot processes, the slit-diaphragms, are thought to create a molecular sensor of renal filtration that prevents the passage of macromolecules while allowing water and small solutes to pass.
Podocytes also contribute to the glomerular basement membrane by secreting collagen and maintain glomerular endothelial cell fenestration by secreting VEGFA. They have been shown to play a role in inducing cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, and inflammatory response, consistent with their essential function in the kidney. 
The importance of podocytes is further emphasized by the effects of their damage or loss. Abnormalities in podocytes often result in severe kidney diseases (podocytopathies), including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD). Injury to the podocytes can result in \"effacement\" or flattening of foot processes, leading to increased permeability of the filtration barrier and proteinuria (an excess of serum protein in urine) which is a common symptom of kidney diseases.

These cells are present in various types of epithelial tissues in the human body, including the intestinal tract, endocrine glands, and certain parts of the renal system. 
There are multiple types of endothelial cell fenestrations. The most common type is found in systemic capillaries of the endocrine tissue (e.g., pancreatic islets), gastrointestinal mucosa, and renal peritubular capillaries. Here, the fenestrated cells have fenestrations in their peripheral cytoplasm with a unique thin and permeable diaphragm that provides a high degree of selectivity, blocking the passage of larger molecules while allowing the free movement of smaller ones. In contrast, other types of fenestrations, such as the discontinuous epithelium of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, do not have diaphragms. 
Characteristically, fenestrated cells play a vital role in the filtering process of body systems. They are a key part of the glomeruli in the kidneys where blood is filtered under high pressure. The fenestrations present in the endothelial cells lining the capillaries of the glomerulus allow the free passage of water and small solute molecules towards the Bowman's capsule, leaving behind larger proteins and cells in the blood, thereby aiding in the filtration and waste removal process. 
In the endocrine system, fenestrated cells in glandular capillaries allow the prompt release of hormones into the bloodstream. These cells have tightly clustered fenestrations which increase the surface area available for passive diffusion, improving the efficiency of hormone secretion. In villi of the small intestine, these cells increase absorption efficiency, permitting the exchange of water, electrolytes, and nutrients.
Overall, fenestrated cells contribute immensely to important physiological processes of filtration, absorption, and secretion, primarily connecting our body's circulation system with the surrounding tissues and organs.

They are an essential component of the neurovascular unit, a structure critical for maintaining brain homeostasis and a consistent neural microenvironment.
Pericytes play a crucial role in the regulation of microvascular blood flow and permeability. They dynamically respond to changes in blood flow and can relax or contract like smooth muscle cells, thereby controlling capillary diameter and blood flow to the tissues. Moreover, pericytes contribute significantly to the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration, implying their vital role in angiogenesis and the stability of blood vessels. Their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells, reveals their importance in tissue repair and remodeling.
Furthermore, pericytes have demonstrated functions in regulating immune and inflammatory responses. Pericytes also collaborate with endothelial cells in preserving the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, thus protecting the central nervous system from potential damage due to harmful substances and pathogens.

Muscle precursor cells are characterized by their proliferative capacity and rapid differentiation into mature myocytes. They fuse into myotubes, culminating in the formation of muscle fibers. Their responsiveness to signals such as insulin-like growth factors, transforming growth factor-β, and neural inputs enables precise control over their proliferation and differentiation. This regenerative capacity equips them with the ability to repair injured or damaged muscle tissue, a critical function in preserving muscle homeostasis and overall function.

M cells are characterized by apical microfolds (hence their alternate name) which express unique adhesion molecules that enable them to sample the luminal macromolecules. 
Other morphological features that distinguish M cells from other intestinal mucosal cells include sparse microvilli and a reduced thickness of the glycocalyx, which permits adhesion while not hindering the transport of molecules. They also have unique intraepithelial invaginations on the basolateral side which are filled with macrophages and other immune cells that can process the engulfed macromolecules quickly. 
These morphological characteristics enable M cells to serve a dual role in immune responses. They initiate the immune response by transporting antigens (such as toxic or pathogenic substances) across the epithelial layer to lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells in the underlying lymphoid tissue. This specialized transport process is called 'transcytosis.' They also have specialized molecules like glycoprotein-2 for bacterial uptake. Simultaneously, M cells help maintain immune tolerance to food antigens and commensal bacteria, preventing unnecessary reactions to non-pathogenic substances and hypersensitivity conditions. While these functions are crucial for well-being, M cell dysfunction can lead to serious conditions like Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases.

They are named after Santiago Ramon y Cajal and Gustaf Retzius, who first discovered them independently in the late 19th century. These neurons are characterized by horizontally oriented bipolar or multipolar cell bodies, facilitating their function in structuring the architecture of the cortex.
The primary role of Cajal-Retzius cells is to mediate the correct formation of the cortical layers in the developing brain. They accomplish this chiefly through the secretion of the extracellular matrix protein Reelin, which interacts with receptors on migrating neurons to control neuronal migration and position. The Reelin signal provided by Cajal-Retzius cells is essential to establish the cortical plate, where new neurons arising from the ventricular zone accumulate and form the recognizable layered structure of the cortical region. Disruptions in Reelin signaling can lead to reeler-like phenotypes characterized by inversion of cortical layers, demonstrating the importance of these cells during normal brain development.
In addition to layer formation, Cajal-Retzius cells also play a role in synaptic plasticity, which is a key aspect of learning, memory, and cognitive function. It has been suggested that these cells are involved in establishing the first functional synapses in the developing cortex, providing initial neural network activity. Furthermore, they have been linked to the modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) trafficking, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and thus, the fine-tune of the neural network activity during early postnatal life. Despite their disappearance shortly after birth in rodents and during early adolescence in humans, Cajal-Retzius cells lay the groundwork for the structure and functionality of the brain's cortical region.

They are one of the four main endocrine cell types present in the pancreatic islets, along with type A, B and D cells. PP cells are notable for their production of pancreatic polypeptide, an anorexigenic hormone that modulates food intake and energy homeostasis. 
By secreting pancreatic polypeptide, PP cells play a significant role in the management of both digestive and appetite regulation. Upon ingestion of food, there is a significant increase in the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide, which then reduces biliary secretion and helps slow down the movement of food through the digestive tract. This allows more time for digestion to take place and nutrients to be absorbed, promoting the efficient use of dietary intake. The pancreatic polypeptide further reduces appetite by interacting with the hypothalamus, the area of the brain responsible for control of hunger.
Given their important role in digestion, malfunction or damage to PP cells can lead to a disturbance in the digestive process and contribute to some disease conditions. For example, an overproduction of pancreatic polypeptide can result in conditions such as pancreatic tumors and diabetes. Conversely, an under secretion might contribute to obesity due to impaired dietary control. Furthermore, PP cells may also play a role in the body's energy balance, suggesting their implication in conditions related to energy metabolism.

These cells are located at the ends of growing capillary sprouts, their position giving them the term \"tip\" cells. 
Endothelial tip cells are characterized by a number of attributes which facilitate them to lead the way in angiogenesis: They have a highly dynamic, large, and polarized shape, and they extend numerous long and mobile filopodia, or finger-like projections, which continuously probe the extracellular microenvironment for cues that control the growth and movement of the cells. The filopodia are equipped with several receptors, including Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) -2 and -3, which respond to guidance signals during angiogenesis. Their distinctive morphology with a broad leading edge and small cell body trailing behind helps in efficiently moving in the right direction responding to cues.
The function of endothelial tip cells is fundamental to the angiogenesis process. Guiding the sprouting vessel, they direct the subsequent proliferation and migration of the stalk cells, which follow the tip cells and form the body of the sprout. These tip cells do not proliferate, but instead, dictate the division of stalk cells, leading to the elongation of the sprout. They also help in lumen formation. The guidance and sprouting decisions of endothelial tip cells are critical for creating a functional and efficient network of vessels that can appropriately supply oxygen and nutrients to tissues. Notably, tip cells play a role in pathological conditions such as tumor angiogenesis and eye diseases, making them an important area of research in cell biology and medicine.

The polarity of these cells is highly specialized. The apical (ventricular) side, facing the cerebrospinal fluid, is characterized by numerous microvilli and cilia, while the basolateral (vascular) side is located adjacent to the choroidal interstitium. 
The main function of the choroid plexus epithelial cells is to produce cerebrospinal fluid, an essential fluid that provides mechanical protection, nutrient delivery, and waste removal to and from the brain and spinal cord. These cells actively transport ions, glucose, and other molecules from the blood into the ventricles, driving the osmotic movement of water and the formation of cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebrospinal fluid turnover rate is remarkably high, with the choroid plexus epithelial cells producing approximately 500 mL each day.
Another noteworthy function of choroid plexus epithelial cells is their role as a constituent of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Their organized pattern and tightly connected structure play a key role in strictly controlling the entry of substances from the blood to the  cerebrospinal fluid, thus protecting the central nervous system from potentially harmful substances and fluctuations in blood composition. As such, these cells also serve in the transport of certain molecules into the central nervous system and in the clearance of waste products from the  cerebrospinal fluid. Emerging evidence also shows that these cells contribute to brain immune responses acting as immunological sentinels.

The distinct characteristic of urothelial cells is their ability to stretch and contract depending on the volume of liquid they contain - a feature that facilitates the essential role they play in maintaining the functionality and integrity of the urinary system.
The primary function of urothelial cells is to provide an impermeable barrier to urine, preventing the toxic components present in the urine from seeping back into the body's bloodstream. The urothelium consists of a superficial umbrella cell layer, 1–2 layers of intermediate cells, and a basal cell layer. The umbrella layer is composed of large, mostly binucleated cells that are covered in an asymmetrical unit membrane, the uroplakin plaques. These plaques function to seal the apical membrane of the bladder from the toxic and highly variable contents of urine. The lipid bilayer structure of uroplakin plaques has an exceptionally high concentration of uroplakins that contribute to the barrier function of the urothelium.
Beyond their mechanical function, urothelial cells also play a role in sensing and signaling changes in the urinary system. They express a number of sensor molecules or respond to thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli and can release chemical mediators. This allows them to act as sensory transducers because they detect changes in the filling state of the bladder and transmit this information to the nervous system. Moreover, these versatile cells contribute to the defense mechanism against urinary tract pathogens. They respond to bacterial infections by releasing chemical messengers, cytokines and chemokines, to attract immune cells, and also can engulf pathogens via endocytosis.

There are approximately 1 million RGCs in a typical human eye, each receiving inputs from multiple photoreceptor cells. As the only neurons in the retina that send information to the brain, they are the final output neurons of the vertebrate retina, and their axons constitute the majority of fibers in the optic nerve. 
The primary function of RGCs is to receive visual information from photoreceptors via intermediary bipolar and amacrine cells, process it, and transmit it to the brain through their axons. The information that RGCs relay encompasses various aspects of the visual field, including color, contrast, brightness, and motion. A diverse population of RGCs, up to 30 distinct subtypes, each contributes to a specific aspect of vision, such as object motion, edge detection, or color contrast, illustrating the complexity of visual data processing that occurs already at the retinal level.
RGCs also play a role in the regulation of circadian rhythms and the pupillary light reflex. Some RGCs contain the photopigment melanopsin and respond directly to light, separately from the retinal rod and cone cells found in the outer retina. These photosensitive RGCs are primarily involved in subconscious vision, particularly the regulation of circadian rhythms and the pupillary light reflex in response to changes in ambient light intensity. Hence, RGCs serve a highly specialized and diverse role in transmitting visual information and regulating light-dependent responses, view modalities, and key physiological processes.

They play a crucial role in the visual system by integrating and regulating the input from multiple photoreceptor cells, which sense and respond to light. Retina horizontal cells are so named due to their characteristic flat horizontal orientation, with their dendrites and axons coursing laterally in a plane parallel to the retinal surface.
Retina horizontal cells are synaptically connected with photoreceptor cells (i.e., cones and rods) and bipolar cells. Their primary function is to facilitate the process of lateral inhibition, where an excited neuron reduces the activity of its neighbors. This capability is central to the phenomenon of \"contrast enhancement\" in visual perception, where the borders between light and dark areas are accentuated to better resolve images. Retina horizontal cells receive inputs from these neighboring photoreceptor cells and transmit their inhibitory output to not only photoreceptor cells but also bipolar cells, fine-tuning the responsiveness to changes in light intensity and differences in wavelengths.
Moreover, retina horizontal cells play a substantial role in adaptation of retinal response to different light levels. In bright light conditions, they aid the reduction of the overall response to light stimuli, thus aiding in the prevention of photoreceptor saturation. These neurons are adept at adjusting the gain and thus the dynamic range of photoreceptors supporting the vision process under variable lighting conditions - from dim moonlight to bright sunshine. Therefore, retina horizontal cells contribute considerably to the adaptability, sharpness, and detail perception of our visual system.

These cells are elongated, branched, and contain a single centrally located nucleus. Their anatomy is composed primarily of densely packed myofibrils, which are protein structures that consist of sarcomeres - the fundamental units of muscle contraction. Cardiac muscle cells are united at their ends through specialized junctions known as intercalated discs, which allow the heart to contract in a unified, powerful and rhythmic way.
Functionally, cardiac muscle cells are responsible for the heart's consistent pumping action that circulates blood throughout the body. Unlike most cells in the body, cardiac muscle cells spontaneously depolarize and generate action potentials without external stimulation. This unique trait stems from the presence of ion channels in the cells' membrane that allow a cyclic flow of ions across the membrane, which create the electrical impulses necessary for heart contraction. The spread of these electrical signals from one cardiac muscle cell to another - facilitated by the interconnected network made by the intercalated disks - results in a synchronized contraction of the heart muscle.
Unlike skeletal muscle cells which can tire and need rest, cardiac muscle cells have to work ceaselessly throughout the entire lifespan, without the opportunity for rest, to ensure continuous circulation of blood. This is made possible through the high volume of mitochondria and a constant supply of oxygen from coronary circulation. In conclusion, cardiac muscle cells, through their unique structure and vital functionality, play a pivotal role in sustaining life by providing the means for blood to reach every cell in the body.

As such, these cells play a pivotal role in our ability to interpret and perceive visual information.
The structure of retinal bipolar neurons is unique and significant to their function. They are termed \"bipolar\" due to their morphology, having two poles: a single dendrite on one end and an axon on the other. The dendrite end connects to photoreceptor cells (rods or cones), while the axon end synapses with retinal ganglion cells. In the center of the dendrite and axon lies the cell body, which houses the cell's nucleus and other vital organelles.
At the functional level, retinal bipolar neurons can be categorized into ON and OFF types based on their response to light. 'ON' bipolar cells are depolarized (electrical potential across the cell membrane decreases) under light conditions, thereby increasing their rate of neurotransmitter release onto the downstream ganglion cells. In contrast, 'OFF' bipolar cells are hyperpolarized (electrical potential increases) in light conditions, decreasing their rate of neurotransmitter release. This dual system allows for a fine-tuned response and the ability to perceive differences in light intensity and contrast, thus creating a nuanced and detailed visual world.

They belong to the category of interneurons, or connector cells, effectively conveying visual information under low light conditions. Non-mammalian and mammalian visual systems feature these cells serving as the primary conduit for scotopic (night vision) signals.
These cells harness their strategic position in the retina's inner nuclear layer to receive information from the rod photoreceptor cells and transmit it to amacrine and ganglion cells. Structurally, they are named bipolar due to their distinctive shape, with dendrites extending towards the outer retina to connect with rod cells, while their axons lead inwards to form synapses with ganglion and amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer. Each rod bipolar cell tends to interface with several rod cells and several downstream neurons, forming intricate networks.
Bearing intricate dendritic trees, these cells can integrate responses from multiple rod cells efficiently, amplifying the retinal signal's strength. They employ glutamate, a type of neurotransmitter, to govern synaptic communication between photoreceptor cells and downstream neurons. This stratified arrangement of rod bipolar cells endows them with the capability to translate light signals into neural signals, predominantly maintaining the spatial and temporal resolution of our visual perception in dim lighting. They are key to our night vision and our ability to detect changes in our light environment.

The myeloid lineage constitutes a significant portion of the body's defense system, particularly against microbial pathogens and foreign substances. Myeloid leukocytes originate from hematopoietic stem cells located in the bone marrow. The commitment of a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell into a myeloid progenitor cell represents the initiation step towards the development of myeloid leukocytes. Once differentiated, these cells contribute diversely to both the innate and adaptive immune responses in the body.
Myeloid leukocytes include several distinct cell types based on functionality and structure, encompassing monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), and dendritic cells. Each cell type has specialized functions, occupying a unique role in the body's immune response. For instance, neutrophils are prolific phagocytes—cells that engulf and destroy pathogens—while eosinophils are instrumental in combating multicellular parasites and modulating allergic inflammatory responses. Monocytes, in addition to their phagocytic activities, can enter peripheral tissues and differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells which are crucial for antigen presentation to T cells.
Another critical function of myeloid leukocytes is their involvement in tissue remodeling and repair. For example, macrophages not only play a key role in defending the body but also perform duties essential for wound healing, such as removing dead cells and stimulating tissue repair. In general, myeloid leukocytes participate in the removal of old and damaged cells, an essential process for maintaining good health and homeostasis. Through the orchestration of complex interactions and signal transductions, myeloid leukocytes provide the body with a robust defense system against foreign invaders and participate in maintaining the body's overall balance and function.

Named for their affinity to eosin, a red acidic dye used in staining procedures, eosinophils contribute to the immune system's response by migrating to inflammation sites, particularly those produced by allergic reactions and infections due to multicellular parasites. They comprise ~1-5% of the white blood cells in circulation.
Eosinophils play crucial roles in mediating inflammatory responses. They carry granules containing a variety of enzymes and proteins, including major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). These enzymes and proteins are effective in killing bacteria, parasites, and some cancer cells. When exposed to an antigen, eosinophils degranulate and release these mediators to the site of infection, resulting in the destruction of invading microorganisms. Specifically, in parasitic infections, eosinophils attach themselves to the parasites and release these cytotoxic granules, causing a lethal rupture in the parasite's surface. Eosinphils may also release cytokines to attract other immune cells to sites of infection and to skew the response towards type 2 immunity.
Eosinophils are also involved in conditions such as asthma and allergic reactions. They secrete chemical mediators such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins that trigger contraction of smooth muscles, causing symptoms such as bronchoconstriction observed in asthma. However, these multifunctional cells, while useful in defending the body, may also inadvertently cause tissue damage if excessively activated. Increased numbers of eosinophils, a condition known as eosinophilia, can indicate a variety of diseases including allergies, skin disorders, parasitic and fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, certain types of cancer, and asthma.

Phenotypically and functionally, neutrophils represent a heterogeneous cell population. They are the immune system’s immediate responders and are the first cells to migrate towards the site of an infection. They play a critical role in defending the body from potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Their primary mechanism of action involves phagocytosis, where they engulf and destroy these microbes. Neutrophils are characterized by the presence of large quantities of granules containing antimicrobial proteins and enzymes, including defensins and myeloperoxidase, which are released once the cell has recognized and attached to the microbes. The enzymes and other antimicrobial agents can also be released into the surrounding environment, a process known as degranulation.
Neutrophils also possess the unique biological ability to eliminate pathogens through a process called neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, or NETosis. In this process, neutrophils release a mixture of DNA, histones, and granule proteins that form a web-like structure which traps and kills microbes. Notably, this process usually leads to the death of the neutrophil itself, referred to as cell suicide or programmed cell death. 
Neutrophils play a crucial role in the immune system by rapidly responding to infections and inflammation, excessive or dysregulated neutrophil activity can contribute to tissue damage and chronic inflammation, exacerbating various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and neutrophils may contribute to tumor growth and progression.

Immature neutrophils can be found in circulation, but their numbers may increase drastically during infection. These cells are released from the bone marrow as a result of emergency granulopoiesis. The role of these cells in infection and acute inflammation remains controversial, and it has been suggested that these cells could possess immunosuppressive or proinflammatory activity. 
An increase of immature neutrophils in the bloodstream, a condition referred to as bandemia or a left shift, can be an important clinical indicator. While low-level presence is typical, an abnormally high count can signal severe or systemic bacterial infection, inflammation, or less commonly, diseases that affect bone marrow function such as leukemia. However, not all bacterial infections will result in a left shift.

Unlike conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), plasmacytoid dendritic cells are characterized by their distinctive plasma cell-like morphology. These cells play vital roles in the innate and adaptive immune response, particularly in the antiviral response. Highly prevalent in the blood and lymphoid organs, pDCs are rare in non-lymphoid tissues, with the exception of inflamed tissues and tumors where they are often recruited.
A key role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells is their rapid and robust production of type 1 interferons in response to viral infections. This is crucial for antiviral defense as interferon signals to other immune cells to increase their antiviral defenses. pDCs achieve this by detecting viral nucleic acids in the cytosol through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), specifically TLR7 and TLR9. Upon recognition, these cells quickly produce substantial amounts of interferons, which plays a significant role in the containment of viral replication and the development of acquired antiviral immunity.
The potential of plasmacytoid dendritic cells for antigen presentations to naive T cells is relatively low under steady-state conditions. Upon activation by certain stimuli, such as viruses or CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, they have the ability to differentiate into efficient antigen-presenting cells. This transition to activated cells involves an upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and co-stimulatory molecules, thus allowing them to effectively present antigenic peptides to naive T cells. This crucial function in linking innate and adaptive immunity underlines the importance of pDCs to the overall immune response.

The term 'alpha-beta' refers to the two distinct types of chains, alpha (α) and beta (β), which form the T cell receptor (TCR) located on the cell's surface. This T cell receptor enables the cell to identify and bind to specific antigens in order to initiate an immune response.
Immature alpha-beta T cells arise from lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and migrate to the thymus, where the maturation of T cells takes place. In the thymus, immature cells (thymocytes) undergo a series of division and differentiation events characterized by the rearrangement of their TCR genes. Upon successful recombination, the cells express a functional alpha-beta TCR on their surface and can then be subjected to a process of selection based on the specificity of the newly expressed receptors. These stages of development are critical to ensuring that only cells with a suitable TCR repertoire survive, ready to be deployed within the immune system. 
Multiple subsets of immature alpha-beta T cells can be distinguished, depending on the developmental and differentiation stage, including CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes, CD4+ or CD8+ single positive thymocytes and immature NK T cells. 
Immature alpha-beta T cells are critically important to immune function. They constitute the foundation for the adaptive immune system - a fundamental component in combating pathological agents. Once fully matured, these cells can differentiate further into effector T cell types (like helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells), each having unique functional roles in an immune response. The proper development of immature alpha-beta T cells is fundamental to the overall health and efficacy of the immune system.

They derive their name from the alpha and beta chains that make up their characteristic T-cell receptor (TCR), a protein complex that binds to antigens. These cells undergo a maturation process in the thymus, where they learn to recognize self-antigens, thus achieving self-tolerance.
Maturation of alpha-beta T cells takes place in the thymus and is tightly controlled by various transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. They develop through several stages from progenitors to mature T cells, from CD4-CD8- double negative cells to CD4+CD8+ double positive cells, until they eventually become CD4+ or CD8+ single positive cells.
Once matured, alpha-beta T cells primarily serve as regulators and effectors in an immune response. They are adept at recognizing fragments of antigens, often viruses or bacteria, presented on the surface of other cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Once they encounter and recognize an antigen, they become activated, proliferate and differentiate into distinct subsets of effector T cells, such as cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, and Natural Killer (NK) cells, each with a specific role in immune response.
Cytotoxic T cells, the effector cells for cell-mediated immunity, are adept at killing cells that have been infected, particularly with viruses. They do this by binding to infected cells and releasing cytotoxic substances which induce apoptosis, or cell death, thus eliminating the infected cells. The main function of NK cells is to kill virally infected cells, and to detect early signs of cancer. Helper T cells do not kill infected cells directly but play a key role in modulating or orchestrating the immune response by releasing cytokines that recruit and regulate other immunity cells such as B cells and macrophages. Therefore, the versatile roles of mature alpha-beta T cells are vital for maintaining the body's successful adaptive immune defenses.

This particular T regulatory cell is characterized by CD4 proteins and a high level of CD25 (the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor) on its cell surface. The T-cell receptor (TCR) of these Treg cells is composed of alpha and beta protein chains, making them a subtype of the alpha-beta T cell population that recognize and bind to antigens presented by MHC class II molecules.
The primary function of CD4-positive, CD25-positive, alpha-beta Treg cells is regulating immune responses, ensuring that the immune response is proportionate and preventing autoimmunity, maintaining peripheral immune tolerance, and limiting chronic inflammation. They achieve this regulation by suppressing or downregulating the proliferation of effector immune cells, which are activated in response to antigens, to prevent their excessive or uncontrolled activity. 
CD4-positive, CD25-positive, alpha-beta Treg cells can suppress immune responses via a variety of mechanisms, including the release of inhibitory cytokines, in particular IL-10 and TGFβ, or through cytolysis of effector immune cells (e.g. antibody-producing B cells) involving perforin and granzymes. They can also modulate the maturation or function of dendritic cells, which are key antigen-presenting cells, and thereby reduce their ability to stimulate effector T cells.
This downregulation also suppresses effector T cell functions against self-antigens—proteins that are innate to the body—to prevent autoimmunity. In essence, Treg cells act as a policing force within the immune system to maintain balance and prevent overreaction which can potentially lead to damaging effects.
Besides their crucial role in preventing autoimmunity, CD4-positive, CD25-positive, alpha-beta Treg cells contribute to other functions such as tumor immune evasion, maternal-fetal tolerance, and transplantation tolerance. By suppressing the cytotoxic T cell response, these cells may inadvertently help tumor cells evade destruction, contributing to cancer progression. However, this characteristic can be potentially manipulated for therapeutic applications in immune-related diseases or transplantation, further highlighting the potential and importance of CD4-positive, CD25-positive, alpha-beta regulatory T cells in immune regulation.

A key feature of these cells is the expression of CD8, a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a co-receptor for the T cell receptor (TCR). Notably, the alpha-beta refers to the TCR heterodimer on the T cell, utilized to recognize the antigens displayed by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules on antigen-presenting cells.
Functioning primarily to combat intracellular pathogens, CD8+ T cells primarily seek and destroy cells infected by viruses or transformed by cancer. The TCR on the CD8+ T cell recognizes and binds to the antigen-MHC I complex displayed on the infected cell’s surface. Following this interaction, along with the engagement of co-stimulatory molecules, the T cell becomes activated. Upon activation, the CD8+ T cell proliferates and differentiates into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), ready to survey the body for the recognized antigen. 
CTLs employ two major cytotoxic mechanisms: the release of cytotoxic granules and the expression of death-inducing ligands on their surface. Cytotoxic granules contain perforin, a protein that forms pores in the targeted cell membrane, and granzymes, enzymes that trigger apoptosis inside the targeted cell through the activation of caspases. The Fas ligand and TRAIL death-inducing ligands on CTLs also bind to their respective receptors on the target cell and initiate a caspase cascade leading to cell death of the target. This cytotoxic function of the CD8+ alpha-beta T cell is critical in the control of infections and in cancer surveillance.

This process also helps create a memory response for the same pathogens, enabling quicker responses in subsequent encounters.
With a majority of pathogens entering the body through the epithelial surfaces like skin and mucous membranes, having these T cells strategically located in these layers enables an effective first line of defense. Apart from pathogen detection and removal, they also contribute to maintaining tissue integrity and providing a surveillance mechanism against tumorigenic cells.

They are ‘unconventional’ T cells defined by the expression of T-cell receptors (TCRs) that are heterodimers  composed of γ and δ chains.
Unlike their alpha-beta (αβ) T-cell counterparts, which recognize antigens via Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, γδ T-cells are activated in an MHC-independent manner perceive their targets in a more direct manner, reacting to stress-induced self molecules or unprocessed antigens, providing a more rapid immune response.
Mature γδ T-cells derive from double-negative CD4− CD8− (DN) thymocytes, which can give rise to either αβ T or γδ T cell lineages. γδ T cells then develop from this precursor following a single selection step mediated by the γδ TCR; unlike cells in the αβ T cell lineage, they do not progress through to a double positive stage. Instead, most γδ T cells remain double-negative and develop into mature γδ T cells before they egress from the thymus.
Upon maturation, γδ T-cells characteristics of both innate and adaptive immunity and can have both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. Mature γδ T-cells fall into distinct IFNγ- and IL-17A-producing cell populations that can be distinguished by CD27 and CCR6 expression, respectively. The mature γδ T-cell population also includes γδ intraepithelial T-cells and dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs), which are only present in the epidermis of rodents. 
These phenotypically different mature γδ T-cells are functionally versatile. In addition to their role in immunosurveillance against microbes and tumor cells, aiding in early defense against invaders. They produce a cytokine and chemokine response and exert cytolysis of infected or transformed target cells (involving perforin and granzymes). They can assist with tissue repair in certain organs like the skin and muscle due to their ability to produce growth factors. In humans, specific γδ T-cells are able to serves as professional antigen presenting cells. Finally, because these cells are able to recognize and lyse tumors in an MHC-unrestricted manner, they have a huge potential for pan-population tumor immunotherapy.

Similar to mature effector T cells, mature NK T cells represent a heterogeneous group of effector cells, which express different transcription factors and cytokines and hence have different effector functions in both innate and adaptive immune responses. They are CD1d-restricted T lymphocytes: they recognize endogenous and exogenous lipid antigens presented by the MHC-like molecule CD1d. They have been classified into two subpopulations based on their TCR usage and specificity for lipid antigen: Type I NK T cells have an invariant TCRα-chain while type II NK T cells have a more diverse TCR repertoire. 
Mature NKT cells have been shown to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions and modulate immune responses, including cancer, autoimmunity, allergy, infection and graft-versus-host disease. The primary function of mature NK T cells is to rapidly respond to infections by releasing large amounts of cytokines to aid cell-to-cell communication in immune responses. They also play a role in recognizing and eliminating certain types of cancer cells. Upon activation via their TCRs, mature NK T cells can promptly release a plethora of cytokines including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4).

The M1/M2 classification is based upon macrophage polarization rather than macrophage location and refers to macrophage activation towards either a more inflammatory or more resolving phenotype, respectively, although the functional diversity of macrophages is more nuanced than such a dichotomy suggests.
Inflammatory macrophages are derived from monocytes recruited to a site of infection or injury. M1 macrophages are classically activated, typically by IFN-γ or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Upon sensing signs of inflammation, they quickly respond by increasing their pro-inflammatory activity. They achieve this by producing a range of signaling molecules, such as nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and numerous cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1, -6 and -12. The release of these potent molecules helps to recruit other immune cells to the site, killing off pathogenic organisms and facilitation inflammation. At the same time, M1 macrophages can also present antigens to T cells, thereby helping to induce an adaptive immune response. Over time, these macrophages may transition in phenotype and function to help resolve the inflammation and promote tissue repair.
Despite the beneficial role of inflammatory macrophages in dealing with pathogens, chronic activation of these cells can lead to harmful effects. Over time, continuous production of pro-inflammatory molecules can cause damage to tissues and organs. This is seen in certain chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and various autoimmune disorders. In such situations, the normally protective function of inflammatory macrophages is not properly controlled, which can contribute to disease pathology.

Some macrophages may also originate from circulating monocytes released from the bone marrow and differentiate into macrophages upon entering tissue. Tissue-resident macrophages are given different names depending upon the tissue in which they reside, such as Kupffer cells in the liver, alveolar macrophages in the lungs, and microglia in the brain.
Tissue-resident macrophages are responsible for the phagocytosis of pathogenic substances and dead cells, serving as part of the foremost line of defense against invading microorganisms. They utilize pattern recognition receptors to identify foreign substances and function as antigen-presenting cells to induce adaptive immunity. Additionally, they produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines, signaling molecules that recruit additional immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation and regulate immune responses.
In addition to their immunological roles, tissue-resident macrophages also have tissue-unique functions. In the liver, Kupffer cells play a role in iron homeostasis, while in the brain, microglia are responsible for synaptic pruning during development. In the lungs, alveolar macrophages are involved in the removal of airborne particles and debris. This underscores their significance in not only providing pathological immunity but also in maintaining the optimal function of the tissues in which they reside. \"

CNS macrophages are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. CNS macrophages have distinct morphologies: Meningeal and perivascular macrophages have a more elongated shape than microglia, which are characterized by a small cell body with fine processes; in contrast, choroid plexus macrophages typically have a stellate shape.
Microglia are the most abundant abundant mononuclear phagocytes and have been shown to play a number of physiological roles, including proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions, synaptic pruning and remodeling, and apoptotic cell removal through phagocytosis. Non-parenchymal CAMs primarily support the barrier function against external antigens. Meningeal macrophages have been shown to respond to peripheral microbial challenges and to protect the brain against fatal viral infection.

M2 macrophages cells are differentiated from their precursors generally in response to Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interleukin-13 (IL-13). Tissue-resident macrophages are also sometimes said to have an “M2-like” phenotype. M2 macrophages play key roles in immunoregulation and disease resolution.

CD8αα IEL have been studied extensively in mice, but equivalent cells are thought to be present in humans, albeit at lower numbers. 
These cells represent a subset of intraepithelial T lymphocytes characterized by the expression of both CD8-alpha-alpha homodimer and the alpha-beta variant of the T cell receptor (TCR). Other features shared with intraepithelial T lymphocytes include the expression of T-bet, a master transcription factor that controls expression of proinflammatory cytokines, natural killer cell receptors, and an activated phenotype (high expression of CD69). 
Functionally, CD8αα IELs are thought to play a role in maintaining epithelial integrity, local immune surveillance, and protection against microbial pathogens. Upon detecting alterations associated with infection or inflammation, these cells orchestrate immune responses to restore tissue homeostasis, primarily through the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, and directly eliminating infected cells. 
CD8αα IELs have been shown require β2 microglobulin-dependent MHC class I expression for their generation and/or homeostasis. They share some characteristics with natural killer cells and might have similar suppressive and regulatory roles which they perform through the production of IL-10 and TGFβ.

This unique receptor pattern characterizes the regulatory role of these cells in the immune system and distinguishes them from their counterparts - the CD16-positive, CD56-dim NK cells, which have cytotoxic killing actions instead.
CD16-negative, CD56-bright NK cells are specialized in immunomodulation and this trait is manifested primarily through the release of substantial amounts of cytokines, including TNF, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and especially IL-10, when they interact with specific target cells or in response to stimulation by cytokines such as IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18.

These cells have a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, bridging the gap between the innate and adaptive immune responses. They achieve this by capturing, processing, and presenting antigens to naive T-cells in the secondary lymphoid organs. This antigen presentation, in conjunction with co-stimulatory signals provided by the cDCs, instructs the T cells whether to mount an immune response against the antigen. cDCs are also very effective in the cross-presentation of antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I, thereby activating CD8+ T cells an initiating a cytotoxic T cell response.
In addition to their role in antigen presentation, cDCs have other important functions in maintaining immune homeostasis. They can perceive signals from the surrounding tissue microenvironment, responding to inflammation, and influencing or even polarizing T cell differentiation into various effector subtypes. Importantly, while cDCs are often associated with immunogenic responses, they also play a crucial role in immune tolerance, particularly towards self-antigens, thereby preventing autoimmune reactions.

These cells are among the smallest neurons in the brain, yet they constitute the bulk of the neural cells in the cerebellum, making cerebellar granule cells the most populous type of neuron in mammals. The granule cells of the cerebellum play an essential role in the functioning of the cerebellar cortex by participating in a complex neuronal network that results in coordination and fine-tuning of motor activities.
Initiating and controlling movement is the primary functional role of cerebellar granule cells. They achieve this through highly sophisticated neuronal networking. Each granule cell gives rise to an axon that ascends into the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex, where it bifurcates into T-shape to form parallel fibers that run perpendicular to the Purkinje cell dendrites. This structure allows a single granule cell to make synaptic contact with hundreds of Purkinje cells and thereby influence their output. Cerebellar granule cells contribute to the generation of movement by transforming unstructured input from mossy fibers into organized output to the Purkinje cells.
Understanding the role of cerebellar granule cells in neural plasticity is an emerging area of study. Recent research suggests that cerebellar granule cells may be involved in learning and memory processes, particularly those related to motor learning. They display unique synaptic plasticity, equipping them with the ability to adjust their response over time, which aids in the learning and storage of motor patterns.

The formation of bone is a complex process involving the action of osteoclasts - cells that break down and reabsorb old bone, followed by osteoblasts that rebuild the bone. Osteocytes serve as coordinators for these two types of bone cells to ensure a balance in the bone remodeling process, contributing to maintaining both bone strength and mineral homeostasis.
The primary functions of osteocytes involve the creation, maintenance, and repair of bone tissue. They ensure that bone remodeling is performed by forming a network within the bone and communicating with other cells to help them respond to mechanical strain and damage.
A remarkable aspect of osteocytes is their ability to perceive mechanical forces, translating them into biochemical signals that regulate bone remodeling and adaptation. Defects in osteocyte function, aside from other bone cells, have been associated with several bone disorders such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, and skeletal manifestations of diabetes.

This production occurs primarily in the bone marrow, where erythroid progenitor cells multiply and differentiate into mature erythrocytes.
Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to the multipotent progenitor (MPP), followed by the common myeloid progenitor (CMP), which further commits to the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP). Commitment to the erythroid lineage proceeds with the burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), which further differentiates into the colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E), also referred to as the erythroid progenitor cell.
Erythroid progenitor cells embark on a journey of progressive maturation marked by cellular changes such as reduced cell size, increased cell density, condensed chromatin structure, and hemoglobin accumulation. The final stages of this maturation process leads to loss of the cell nucleus and the acquisition of the characteristic biconcave shape. This process is tightly regulated through a combination of various growth factors, cytokines, and hormones, the most critical of which is erythropoietin. Aberrations in the differentiation and maturation of these progenitor cells can result in blood diseases such as anemia and polycythemia.

However, it can be difficult to distinguish between these cell types.
ILC1s are non-cytotoxic or weakly cytotoxic, expressing relatively low levels of perforin, and play an important role in the response to viruses, certain intracellular bacteria and parasites, and fungi. Their release of IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) further shapes the adaptive immune response. Their functionality mirrors Th1 helper cells.
While ILC1s have been shown to be important in the response to infections, ILC1s have also been demonstrated to accumulate in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.

These cells are largely tissue-resident, predominantly residing in barrier tissues such as the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. ILC2s are defined by their expression and reliance on the GATA3 transcription factor.
ILC2 cells play a significant role in the immune response, especially against parasitic infections and in allergic responses and autoimmune disorders. They predominantly produce type 2 cytokines including interleukin-5 (IL-5) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) in response to stimuli such as cytokines IL-25 and IL-33, which are often produced by epithelial cells in response to tissue damage. IL-5 is crucial for eosinophil activation, a component of the immune system that plays a key role in combating parasitic infections. Concurrently, IL-13 helps in expelling parasites from the body's system, as well as enforcing barrier integrity.
ILC2s are also instrumental in tissue repair and homeostasis. They help in maintaining body metabolism and fat storage, largely by producing a hormone known as methionine-enkephalin peptides. ILC2 cells also aid in early tissue repair processes, by the secretion of amphiregulin, a growth factor. Despite their protective functions, ILC2 cells can also contribute to pathologies such as asthma and other inflammatory diseases if their actions are not properly regulated.

The grouping of ILC3s originally included lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, which have more recently been categorized separately.
ILC3s play an important homeostatic role in the gastrointestinal tract, contributing to mucosal barrier integrity, lymphoid organogenesis, and controlling the balance between tolerance and immunity to commensal and pathogenic bacteria, respectively. The protective role of ILC3s primarily stems from their capacity to respond to signals of microbial invasion or tissue damage, releasing an array of cytokines such as Interleukin-22 (IL-22) and Interleukin-17 (IL-17) which are dependent upon the RORγt transcription factor. These cytokines in turn mediate protective responses including the enhancement of epithelial barrier function, the promotion of tissue repair, and the control of bacterial infection.
However, ILC3s can also contribute to the development of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis. Therefore, studies have also emphasized the importance of regulatory mechanisms controlling ILC3 activation, providing novel insights into the complexity of immune regulation in maintaining tissue homeostasis.

The term 'pre-conventional' denotes the stage of development of these cells prior to their maturation into conventional dendritic cells, which are critical players in immune responses. 
After leaving the bone marrow, pre-cDCs transiently circulate in the bloodstream to colonize lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, including skin, mucosa, spleen, and lymph nodes where they differentiate into immature conventional dendritic cells, which undergo further differentiation. In mouse and humans, the population of pre-cDCs has been shown to be heterogeneous with two subpopulations that pre-committed to differentiate into different subsets of dendritic cells (cDC1 and cDC2). 
These subsets of differentiated dendritic cells play a key role in the immune response by bringing about the regulation and initiation of T cell responses, thereby shaping the adaptive immunity. One subset is thought to be specialized in highly efficient activation of CD8+ T cells, while the other subset presents exogeneous antigens to CD4+ T cells. 
The main function of pre-conventional dendritic cells is to constantly replenish conventional dendritic cells. In response to infection additional pre-cDCs are recruited to the site of infection to meet increased tissue demand, and this pre-DC recruitment may be necessary for effective T cell responses. The molecular signals that direct pre-cDC migration remain poorly understood but recent research suggest that it involves specific chemokine receptors expressed on pre-cDCs.

Their unique squamous, or flattened, shape allows for a vast surface area that enables a fast rate of diffusion of respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Functionally, type I pneumocytes serve as the site for the critical exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries. These cells are in direct contact with pulmonary capillaries and are therefore primarily responsible for oxygen passing into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide being removed from the bloodstream. It is important to note that these cells are extremely thin and fragile, a feature that promotes easy passage of gases but also renders the cells susceptible to damage.
A unique critical feature of type I pneumocytes is their inability to divide and proliferate. Should damage to these cells occur, repair and replenishment is addressed through the conversion of another cell type, known as type II pneumocytes, into type I pneumocytes. The role of type I cells is thus highly specific, and strictly aligned with enabling efficient respiration - an essential process for all aerobic organisms.

Some of the most important digestive enzymes synthesized by the pancreatic acinar cells include amylase, which digests carbohydrates, lipase, which breaks down fats, and several proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin which are vital for the digestion of proteins. Importantly, these enzymes are produced as proenzymes or zymogens to avoid autolysis, or the breakdown of the pancreas itself.
The release of these enzymes by the pancreatic acinar cells is strictly regulated by hormones and neurochemicals. Cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum cause the release of these enzymes. Moreover, acinar cells also respond to another hormone, secretin, by releasing bicarbonate-rich fluid which helps to neutralize the gastric acid in the duodenum. 
Dysregulation in the function of pancreatic acinar cells can lead to severe health issues, including pancreatitis, which is characterized by inflammatory damage to the organ due to the premature activation of digestive enzymes.

Functionally, these cells are pivotal in glucose metabolism and homeostasis, accounting for about 20% of the total population of cells in the pancreatic islets. 
The primary role of type A enteroendocrine cells involves the synthesis, storage, and secretion of the peptide hormone glucagon, which is critical in energy regulation throughout the body. In response to a decrease in blood glucose levels, the pancreatic A cells are stimulated to secrete glucagon into the bloodstream. Glucagon acts on its target cells, mainly in the liver, to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis processes, thereby increasing blood glucose levels back to normal. In this way, pancreatic A cells play an integral role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing hypoglycemia.
Pancreatic A cells also participate in the local regulation of islet activities as glucagon acts through glucagon receptors on A, B and D type cells within the islets. Recent studies have also shown that Pancreatic A cells play a role in the generation and regeneration of B type cells. Following beta cell injuries pancreatic A cells increase in numbers and produce Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases the proliferation and cytoprotection of beta cells. In response to extreme injury of B type cells pancreatic A cells can transform (transdifferentiate) into functioning B type cells.
Until recently, glucagon has been considered a pancreas-specific hormone; however, extrapancreatic glucagon has been reported in patients who had undergone complete, and glucagon-positive cells been identified in the human stomach, indicating that Type A enteroendocrine cells are not restricted to the pancreas.

The high electron density and presence of a prominent tubulovesicular system in the apical cytoplasm are other defining microscopic features. 
The primary function of brush cells is chemosensation within the tracheobronchial system, including the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles. They have been identified as the pulmonary equivalent of taste receptor cells, acting as solitary chemosensory cells that serve as the primary line of defense and alarm signal against hazardous inhaled substances. Brush cells in the tracheobronchial tree express taste receptors and a taste transduction machinery which allow them to detect specific chemical signals from bacteria or environmental toxins and signal a downstream response such as protective reflexes like coughing and increased mucus secretion.
Brush cells also act as physical barriers to help filtrate and clean the inhaled air, thus making an essential contribution to setting up the so-called mucociliary escalator. The tubulovesicular system within brush cells likely plays a role in transcytosis, which involves the movement of various substances across the epithelial barrier. Overall, the brush or tuft cells form an integral part of the airway's innate immune system, helping maintain a healthy and functional tracheobronchial tree.

The adrenal cortical cells are further subdivided into three groups based on their position and function: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. The zona glomerulosa cells are scattered and primarily secrete mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone; the zona fasciculata contains large adrenal cortical cells replete with liquids (“clear cells”) that release glucocorticoids; and the zona reticularis contains “compact” cells containing lipofuscin that are involved in the secretion of adrenal androgens.

Meanwhile, adrenal androgens serve as precursors for other sex hormones in both males and females. Therefore, adrenal cortical cells are a central part of the endocrine system, coordinating multiple vital physiological processes.

These myocytes are columnar-shaped cells with centrally located nuclei, and they exhibit visibly striated cytoplasm due to the organized array of myofibrils, which are composed of filaments of actin and myosin. Cardiac myocytes connect with each other through specialized structures called intercalated discs, facilitating electrical and mechanical continuity and enabling synchronous contraction of the heart. They also possess a high number of mitochondria to meet their high energy demand for continuous heartbeat action.
Cardiac myocytes are capable of automaticity, meaning they have the unique ability to spontaneously and rhythmically generate their electrical impulses, a characteristic led by pacemaker cells. The electrical signals initiated and propagated in these cells are responsible for heartbeats. They also respond to the electrical signals transmitted by the autonomic nervous system and chemical signals like hormones. Thus, cardiac myocytes not only participate in maintaining the heart’s function but also play a role in modulating heart rate and strength of contraction in response to the body's changing needs. Consequently, malfunction of these cells leads to serious cardiac diseases such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

They contract and relax during the heart's cycle, modulating the pumping of blood through the atria and into the ventricles. Additionally, endowed with inherent rhythmic electrical activity, atrial myocytes contribute significantly to the initiation and propagation of the heart’s electrical impulses.
A distinguishing feature that separates atrial myocytes from other cardiac myocytes is their ability to synthesize and secrete atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in response to atrial stretch or dilatation. ANP acts as a potent vasodilator and diuretic, helping to maintain blood pressure and volume homeostasis. The phenomena of atrial stretch or distension, which triggers ANP release, is often in response to excess blood volume entering the heart, providing a mechanism at the cellular level which actively regulates systemic cardiovascular balance.
Like all cardiac myocytes, atrial myocytes are embedded in a dense network of connective tissue that provides structural support. These cells are characterized by a single, centrally located nucleus, and overall, have a rod-like appearance with branching ends that connect with adjacent cells to form a continuous, synchronized ensemble. Their cytoplasm is abundant with mitochondria, reflecting the high energy demand associated with constant contraction and relaxation. At the ultrastructural level, atrial myocytes display striations due to the regular arrangement of actin and myosin proteins, which facilitate the contraction process essential for the heart's pump function.

Vascular endothelial cells act as a semi-permeable membrane, controlling the passage of materials and the transit of white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. These cells are also involved in blood coagulation. When a blood vessel is damaged, endothelial cells promote clotting to prevent excessive bleeding and facilitate wound healing. Other functions include regulation of blood pressure and blood volume by releasing vasodilators and vasoconstrictors to either widen or constrict blood vessels, accordingly.
Furthermore, the endothelial cells are crucial in the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. This is particularly important in wound healing and the growth of new tissues during development or after injury. In the context of diseases such as cancer, angiogenesis helps facilitate tumor growth by providing nutrients and oxygen.

This function not only provides a protective shield to internal organs against potentially harmful substances but also regulates the fluid and solute exchange. In terms of transport, these cells facilitate the diffusion of oxygen and essential nutrients from the bloodstream into the tissues. Concurrently, they allow waste products like carbon dioxide to pass from tissues into the bloodstream for removal, making these cells exceptionally instrumental in maintaining the body’s homeostasis.
Moreover, capillary endothelial cells are also actively involved in numerous other physiological processes such as inflammation, blood clotting, and angiogenesis. During inflammation, they can specifically express and secrete molecules to attract white blood cells to sites of damage. Similarly, in blood clotting, they produce substances that prevent blood cells from sticking to the vessel wall and deter the formation of unnecessary clots. In angiogenesis, they proliferate and organize the formation of new blood vessels, crucial for wound healing and embryonic development. The disruption of their function contributes to pathological conditions like edema, thrombosis, and several cardiovascular diseases.

A defining feature of these endo-epithelial cells are the tiny hair-like structures covering their surface, known as cilia. The nucleus is located at the base of the cell, and the area above it is rich in mitochondria and well-developed endoplasmic reticulum, both crucial for the energy-intensive process of cilia operation.
The primary function of these ciliated cells is to keep the respiratory tract clean via mucociliary clearance or the respiratory escalator. These cells create a two-layered 'coat': The lower \"sol\" layer is watery where the cilia can beat in coordinated waves, and the upper \"gel\" layer is thick and sticky, trapping inhaled particles, such as dust, bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful substances. This rhythmical beating of the cilia then moves the mucus and trapped particles upwards and out of the respiratory tract, which is then either coughed out or swallowed.
Damage or dysfunction of these ciliated cells, as seen in diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, or chronic bronchitis, may lead to reduced or ineffective mucociliary clearance and an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.

This specific location assigns endosteal cells critical roles in the bone maintenance and regeneration process as they actively participate in bone remodeling, a process that involves both the formation and resorption of bone tissue.
Endosteal cells function by regulating the activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are cells that deposit new bone, and osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption, a process important for the maintenance, repair, and remodelling of bones. When new bone tissue is required, such as in instances of bone fractures or increased mechanical stress, endosteal cells differentiate into osteoblasts to facilitate the bone formation process. Conversely, when bone resorption is necessary, these cells are known to release signals that lead to the recruitment and activation of osteoclasts.
In addition to this, endosteal cells play a significant role in hematopoiesis, which is the formation of blood cellular components. They function in this process by providing a niche for hematopoietic stem cells, serving to support their maintenance and differentiation. Understanding the functionality of endosteal cells is important in the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy, especially in diseases affecting bone remodeling and hematopoiesis.

The three kinds of granulocytes that derive from myelocytes are neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, each with distinct properties and functions. Myelocytes possess some functionalities of a mature cell such as the presence of specific granules.
The main function of myelocytes is to differentiate into mature granulocytes. The process starts with a hematopoietic stem cell, which progressively matures into a myeloblast, and further into a promyelocyte before eventually becoming a myelocyte. At this stage, the cell begins producing granules that carry specific enzymes and other substances used to fight infections. The most common type of myelocyte is the neutrophilic myelocyte, which eventually develops into a neutrophil, the most common type of white blood cell.
Neutrophilic myelocytes contribute significantly to the body's primary immune response as mature neutrophils are often the first cells to arrive at a site of infection. They ingest and destroy bacteria and other harmful agents to prevent further infection. Eosinophilic and basophilic myelocytes develop into eosinophils and basophils, respectively, playing their role in managing allergic reactions and parasitic infections. Dysfunction in myelocyte development can give rise to various diseases, including different forms of leukemia, where myelocytes undergo uncontrolled proliferation.

Recent research has also elucidated an important role for these cells in immunity. Intestinal brush cells have been found to be the source of a cytokine called interleukin-25, which can initiate type 2 immune responses during parasitic infections. This immune function, along with the chemosensing abilities, signifies that brush cells could serve crucial roles in health and disease, although much research is still required to fully elucidate their myriad roles in physiology and pathology.

The primary function of anterior lens cells is to facilitate eye accommodation by controlling the shape and thickness of the eye lens.
The cells are involved in continuous proliferation, migration, and differentiation into lens fiber cells, helping to maintain lens growth and transparency. Anterior lens cells have a prolonged life span and reveal an extraordinary ability to function indefinitely, a characteristic that is critical for maintaining lens transparency. Damage or disturbance to the anterior lens cells can give rise to lens opacity, eventually leading to cataracts, which is a common cause of vision loss.

Lens epithelial cells are also able to divide and differentiate into lens fiber cells and therefore play a fundamental role in lens growth and development. 
The lenses of some species are able to regenerate; the regeneration ability of lenses in higher mammals is relatively weak, but there has been some progress in using lens epithelial cells as endogenous stem cells to achieve the partial regeneration of lens tissue. 
In pathological conditions such as cataracts, the function and behavior of lens epithelial cells can be disrupted, which can lead to cloudy or opaque areas in the lens that interfere with vision.

Lens fibers are differentiated from equatorial epithelial cells of the lens in a process that involves cell elongation, denucleation and tight packing, which serve to reduce light scattering occurrences in the eye. This differentiation accelerates substantially after birth in comparison to during embryogenesis and continues throughout life, contributing to the growth of the eye lens. Secondary lens fibers are specifically those cells that are newly differentiated and cover the old lens fiber core. This process also leads to the removal of light-obstructing cellular components, mainly nuclei and organelles, making these fibers transparent and ideal for their function. 
The fibers carry out their primary function of light refraction via a high concentration of specialized proteins known as crystallins, which form a gradient of refractive index together with the cytoplasm. This index manipulation facilitates precise light focus onto the retina. Secondary lens fibers also contribute to the lens's shape and biomechanical properties through intercellular interactions, particularly at the sutures where the ends of the fibers meet. Any disruption to secondary lens fibers can lead to vision problems, including cataracts, which is the clouding of the lens resulting from the aggregation of crystallin proteins.

The prostate's epithelium has multiple layers, including basal, luminal, and neuroendocrine cells; the luminal layer is composed of columnar epithelial cells, and the basal layer is composed of cuboidal epithelial cells.
Prostatic epithelial cells primarily aid in the production and secretion of prostatic fluid, a critical component of semen. This fluid, which accounts for around 20-30% of semen volume, serves several key functions related to fertility. The prostatic fluid is alkaline in nature that aids in neutralizing acidic vaginal secretions, promoting the survival of sperm in the female reproductive tract. It also contains proteolytic enzymes that, upon ejaculation, lead to the liquefaction of semen, enhancing the motility of sperm. 
Additionally, prostate epithelial cells are involved in the secretion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a kallikrein-like serine protease, which is a normal component of the seminal plasma further aids in semen liquefaction.
Prostatic epithelial cells are also linked to conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia, which involves abnormal cell growth, and prostate cancer, which originates from prostatic epithelial cell transformations, especially in the peripheral zone. Consequently, these cells are key focal points in understanding and treating prostatic conditions and malignancies.

They are predominantly located in the connective tissue or interstitial space of the lung that is in close proximity to the alveolar epithelium and pulmonary capillaries. These cells play a crucial role in maintaining lung structure and function through the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which provides structural support to the lung tissues.
These cells ensure effective gas exchange by providing a scaffold for the epithelial structure. In addition to providing support, the extracellular matrix acts as a binding site for various molecules that can directly influence cell behavior and the local microenvironment. Fibroblasts not only secrete the extracellular matrix themselves but also have the capacity to remodel the matrix by producing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This ability of synthesis and degradation makes fibroblasts essential for normal lung homeostasis and repair following lung injury.
Under pathological conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis, the function of pulmonary interstitial fibroblasts becomes deregulated. They become overly active and produce excess extracellular matrix, notably collagen, resulting in the thickening and stiffening of lung tissues that compromise its function. Furthermore, these cells can transform into myofibroblasts, cells that are more active in producing matrix proteins and contribute to scar formation or fibrosis. Understanding the biology and regulation of pulmonary interstitial fibroblasts is thus essential for devising therapeutic strategies for diseases characterized by abnormal tissue remodeling and fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The fundamental role of intestinal crypt stem cells is to provide a constant supply of new cells to maintain the cellular turnover of the intestinal epithelium, a tissue known for rapid self-renewal. These stem cells are nurtured and protected by specialized epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and together constitute the intestinal stem cell niche. 
An important function of intestinal crypt stem cells is to sustain the balance between cell division and programmed cell death, called apoptosis, to ensure the integrity of the intestinal lining. Given their active proliferation rate, these stem cells initiate the creation of diverse differentiated cell types, including enterocytes (the primary absorptive cells in the intestinal lumen), goblet cells (that produce mucus to protect the epithelial layer), enteroendocrine cells (involved in producing gastrointestinal hormones), and Paneth cells (involved in secreting antimicrobial peptides). This diversity in output regulates the physiological activities of the gut ranging from nutrient absorption, hormone secretion, bacterial balance, to immunity.
Research studies suggest that dysregulation in intestinal crypt stem cell proliferation and differentiation is associated with several intestinal disorders including intestinal cancer, and various enteropathies.

SECs possess distinctive morphological features including a large, flattened shape, an abundance of fenestrations or pores, and the lack of a continuous basement membrane. These structural characteristics distinguish sinusoidal endothelial cells from other, more regularly structured endothelial cells in the body.
Due to their special fenestrated structure, SECs facilitate the exchange of macromolecules, like lipoproteins and hyaluronan, between plasma and the surrounding organ parenchymal cells. These fenestrations act like sieves, allowing the passage of substances based on their size and charge. It's noteworthy that the permeability characteristics of SECs can be regulated dynamically according to the body's homeostatic needs. 
Beyond their key role in exchange mechanisms, endothelial cells of sinusoids are involved in several other functions. In the liver, for example, they help in the removal and endocytic degradation of waste macromolecules, immune response, and regulation of liver regeneration. They also participate in the formation and remodeling of blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Additionally, in recent years, it has been discovered that these cells may have a role in disease conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer.

PP cells are one of the rarer pancreatic cell types and are more prevalent in the head and neck of the pancreas.

The primary function of PP cells is the production and secretion of the pancreatic polypeptide hormone (PP). This hormone plays a crucial role in several gastrointestinal functions and metabolic responses. The release of the PP hormone is stimulated after eating, especially in protein-rich meals, leading to it being present in large amounts during digestion. The fundamental role of PP is to self-regulate pancreatic secretion activities ensuring its exocrine and endocrine functions are under control.
The pancreatic polypeptide hormone from PP cells also aids in adapting to low physical activity and fasting by reducing the production of insulin and glucagon and inhibiting the hepatic glucose production. Additionally, this hormone influences gut motility by slowing down the gastric emptying and reducing small intestinal transit, thereby controlling the pace at which nutritional substances are absorbed. Because of these functions, any malfunction or irregularity in PP cells can result in various disorders such as diabetes and pancreatic diseases.

The ciliary body is responsible for producing the aqueous humor, which is the clear, watery fluid that fills the anterior portion of the eye. These cells, also known as the ciliary epithelium's non-pigmented layer, are located immediately beneath the pigmented ciliary epithelial cells. They play several key roles in maintaining eye health and function and contribute to the eye's intricate physiology.
Together with the endothelial cells of the iris and ciliary blood vessels, the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium form the blood aqueous barrier in the anterior part of the eye. One of the main functions of non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells includes the production and regulation of aqueous humor, which provides nourishment and oxygen supply to the avascular lens and cornea, two vital eye components found in the anterior segment. Aqueous humor also helps to maintain intraocular pressure, which is critical for retaining the shape of the eye. Aberrations in this balance often result in ocular pathologies like glaucoma. Non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells play a key role in the secretory processes that regulate the aqueous humor through active transport, diffusion, and ultrafiltration from the blood plasma. 
Therefore, due to their complex and multi-faceted functions sustaining eye health, non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells represent a critical cell type in eye biology and physiological equilibrium.

Myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland facilitate the expulsion of milk during lactation in response to signaling by the hormone oxytocin. Due to their cytoskeletal composition of actin and myosin, which mirrors that of smooth muscle cells, these cells are able to contract and advance the milk from the alveoli into the ducts, and eventually to the nipple, enabling breastfeeding. 
Other critical roles of myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland include the maintenance of mammary gland integrity and the suppression of tumor formation. They create a mechanical barrier that separates the luminal epithelial cells from the stromal compartment and play a significant role in the suppression of carcinogenesis; loss or alteration of these cells often paves the way for invasive carcinomas.

The main physiological functions they perform are the synthesis, storage, and secretion of milk. During lactation, these cells synthesize the various macromolecular constituents of milk, such as lipids, proteins, and lactose, which are then secreted into the ductal lumen. An intricately coordinated mix of hormonal activation and signaling pathways, involving prolactin and oxytocin amongst others, regulate this process. Luminal cells also exhibit receptivity towards estrogen, and their proliferation is influenced by estrogen and progesterone.
Luminal epithelial cells are also engaged in several other key aspects of mammary gland biology. They carry a role in the formation of the ductal tree during the developmental process and are involved in glandular remodeling during pregnancy and post-weaning involution. Furthermore, luminal epithelial cells, just like other cell types in the breast, are susceptible to oncogenic transformation. In fact, the majority of breast cancers, specifically those classified as ductal carcinomas, are believed to originate from this cell population, underlining the pathophysiological significance of these cells.

They can be categorized into two types: luminal epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells, each with their distinct functions in milk processing and delivery.
Luminal epithelial cells, which are located in the inner layer of the mammary gland ducts and alveoli, play a vital role in the secretion of milk proteins and lipids to form milk during lactation. These cells contain well-developed secretory apparatus, including rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, facilitating the synthesis and secretion of milk proteins. Luminal epithelial cells express markers, like cytokeratin 8 and 18, and hormone receptors, such as estrogen and progesterone receptors, which play a crucial role in regulating the cell proliferation during the mammary gland development and lactation.
Myoepithelial cells, on the other hand, are contractile cells situated between the luminal epithelial cells and the basal lamina in the ducts and alveoli of the mammary gland. They express markers such as smooth muscle actin and p63. One of their chief functions is the contraction during lactation, which aids in the expulsion of milk from the alveoli into the ductal network. Additionally, myoepithelial cells play a role in shaping the mammary gland ductal system and initiating the involution process after weaning.
The homeostasis and functionality of the mammary epithelial cells are sensitive to hormonal regulation and surrounding microenvironment cues. Any abnormalities in these two types of mammary epithelial cells could disrupt the mammary gland function and potentially prompt the development of breast diseases, including cancer.

In humans, the proportion of basal cells in the respiratory epithelium gradually decreases going down the tracheobronchial tree: they represent approximately 34% of the cells in the trachea, 27% in the large airways, and 10% in the small airways, although it is worth noting that there are differences in the compositions of the tracheobronchial epithelia between different species.
Basal epithelial cells serve as the basal layer of the tracheobronchial epithelium, providing both structural and regenerative support for the epithelial tissue that lines the upper regions of the respiratory tract. They serve as progenitor or stem cells that are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types, such as ciliated and secretory cells. This gives them a central role in homeostatic maintenance of the epithelium, and in repairing damaged epithelium after an injury or during disease. This regenerative capacity is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the tracheobronchial surface, especially given its continual exposure to inhaled irritants and microorganisms. 
In addition to their primary restorative function, basal epithelial cells are also involved in the initial immune response within the tracheobronchial tree. Equipped with pattern recognition receptors, these cells can identify and respond to pathogenic organisms, triggering an immune response and producing a range of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, to help combat infections.

Ciliated cells of the bronchus form a crucial part of the body's innate defensive mechanism: They function as a barrier and play a key role in the mucociliary clearance mechanism - the coordinated, wave-like movement of the cilia that sweeps pathogens and particles trapped within the mucus in the airways, upward and out of the lungs, either to be swallowed or expelled by coughing. By doing so, these cells are crucial for preventing the lodging of pathogens deep in the lungs and hence reduce the risk of respiratory infections.
In conditions affecting the respiratory tract, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, the normal functioning of the ciliated cells may be compromised.

Preadipocytes are present in the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissues and can be identified by their fibroblastic morphology and the expression of specific markers such as Pref-1, CD24, CD34, and CD29.
The primary function of preadipocytes is to proliferate and differentiate into mature adipocytes upon receiving the appropriate physiological and hormonal stimuli. The process of adipogenesis, involving the differentiation of preadipocytes, is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) family. Through adipogenesis, preadipocytes contribute to the body's energy storage and insulation capabilities and act as a buffer to control the levels of free fatty acids in the bloodstream. When the energy balance of the body alters, for example during fasting or overnutrition, preadipocytes can respond by modulating adipogenic differentiation and lipid storage, illustrating their dynamic role in metabolic regulation.
Additionally, research has shown that preadipocytes also contribute to endocrine function. They produce and secrete several adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin. These adipokines impact a variety of physiological processes, including appetite regulation, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and immune responses. Dysregulation of preadipocyte function and adipogenesis is associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Brown preadipocytes are distinct in their thermogenic potential due to their capacity to become brown adipocytes, known for heat generation, which is especially crucial in maintaining body temperature in cold environments. These cells are primarily found in mammalian organisms, particularly those that need to adapt to lower temperatures. 
Functionally, brown preadipocytes play an instrumental role in the process of adipogenesis, which is the formation of adipose (fat-storing) tissue. When subjected to specific stimuli or under the appropriate conditions, these cells can differentiate into mature brown adipocytes. These adipocytes contain a high volume of mitochondria and have the unique ability to burn energy and release it as heat, a process known as thermogenesis. This unique energy expenditure process is chiefly due to the presence of a mitochondrial protein called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).
The study of brown preadipocytes and their subsequent conversion into mature brown adipocytes is of significant interest in tackling obesity and related metabolic disorders. Since their thermogenic activity contributes to energy expenditure, they provide an attractive target for approaches looking to increase energy consumption in the body. Emerging research suggests that enhancing the number or activity of brown adipocytes could be a possible avenue for therapeutic interventions against obesity and type 2 diabetes.

The main function of the prostate is to nourish and protect sperm by secreting a slightly alkaline fluid which makes up approximately 30% of the semen. 
The luminal epithelial cells form a single-layer lining in the prostate's acini. They have a polarized structure with the basal side attached to the basal lamina and the apical side facing the lumen. Specialized microvilli-like structures on the apical side aid in product secretion. Luminal cells express androgen receptors, making them sensitive to androgenic stimulation, which is crucial for regulating prostatic secretions and overall gland function.
The prostate's Luminal cells are responsible for producing and releasing prostatic fluid, which supports sperm post-ejaculation. They synthesize key proteins like prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase. 
Luminal cells are also a focus of prostate cancer research as they are the putative cells-of-origin for the majority of prostate cancers. Overproliferation and persistent damage can lead to the initiation of carcinogenic events within these cells. The PSA produced by luminal cells is also a key biomarker for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating prostate cancer.

A key function of the basal cells of the prostate epithelium is to provide structural support to the secretory luminal cells and contribute to maintaining the integrity of the epithelial layer. They also have unique regenerative properties that aid in the recovery of the glandular epithelium after injury. Under normal conditions, these cells remain quiescent, but upon injury, they proliferate to replace the damaged secretory luminal cells, indicating a stem/progenitor cell-like behavior. They also play an important role in serving as a reserve cell population helping in maintaining tissue homeostasis. 
Basal cells of prostate epithelium are also central to understanding the pathobiology of prostate diseases. They are typically absent in prostatic adenocarcinomas, the most common form of prostate cancer, but they are thought to play a critical yet complex role in oncogenesis and therapeutic resistance mechanisms of prostate cancer, and in benign prostatic hyperplasia. They also have the ability to differentiate into neuroendocrine cells or luminal cells under certain conditions, contributing to disease heterogeneity.

They play a critical role in maintaining heart functionality and homeostasis. These cells, flat and squamous in structure, are adjoined closely to form a tight barrier that separates the heart's muscular layer, the myocardium, from the blood flowing through the heart chambers.
Functionally, endocardial cells are key players in several crucial physiological processes within the heart. Synthesizing matrix molecules that contribute to the structural formation of the heart, these cells actively partake in maintaining its structural integrity. They also exhibit unique metabolic activity, which aids in maintaining optimal cardiac functioning in both healthy and pathological conditions. Importantly, they are known for their involvement in modulating myocardial contraction and relaxation, that is crucial for normal heart rhythm and function. They achieve this by producing factors like nitric oxide (NO) which, amongst other things, aids in the regulation of blood pressure, prevents blood clotting and inhibits the adherence of blood cells to the vessel wall.
In pathological states, endocardial cells can undergo a transformation process known as endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which is inherently involved in several cardiac diseases. In this transition, they acquire the ability to migrate and differentiate into several other types of cells contributing to disease progression. Moreover, their dysfunction can lead to endocarditis, an inflammation of the endocardium, as well as increase the risk of other heart diseases.

Highly specialized, these cells play an essential role in the maintenance and repair of corneal tissue, thereby contributing to clear, distortion-free vision. As fibroblasts, their function often involves synthesis and secretion of the extracellular matrix, which gives the corneal stroma its structural integrity.
Keratocytes are primarily responsible for the synthesis of collagen and proteoglycans, the principal components of the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM). The high optical clarity of the cornea is largely attributed to the unique arrangement of collagen fibrils, and keratocytes play a fundamental role in maintaining this arrangement. In response to corneal wounds or injuries, the keratocytes near the wound site become activated and undergo a transformation into a specialized phenotype, often referred to as repair keratocytes or activated keratocytes.
During corneal repair, these activated keratocytes proliferate and migrate to the wound site, where they differentiate into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts play a significant role in wound contraction and synthesis of an alternative ECM required for wound closure. However, the overzealous activity of myofibroblasts can lead to corneal haze, a condition that impairs vision, and numerous studies suggest that optimal wound healing involves a delicate balance between repair and the pro-scar actions of myofibroblasts.

cTECs also play a significant part in the selection and development of T cells. During T cell maturation, these cells express both self and non-self proteins via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to immature T cells. cTECs then stimulate the T cells that can recognize such proteins, an important event known as positive selection. This process aids in the creation of a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire that can react to a wide range of antigens, therefore ensuring effective immunity. 
Apart from aiding in T cells' positive selection, cTECs also contribute to eliminating self-reactive T cells, a role essential in preventing autoimmune diseases. These cells induce an apoptosis-driven process known as \"negative selection\" which eliminates T cells that are too highly reactive to self-antigens.

The primary function of mTECs revolves around negative selection of developing T cells, thus preventing autoimmune responses. mTECs allow developing T cells to recognize and be responsive to foreign antigens while remaining tolerant to the body's own tissues. They achieve this through a process called promiscuous gene expression where they express and display a vast array of self-antigens. This process is regulated by a transcriptional regulator called autoimmune regulator (Aire), which contributes to immunological self-tolerance.
mTECs themselves have a self-renewing ability and sustain the continuous export of mature T cells. They also express a number of genes that encode for chemokines and other signaling molecules which draw in and retain developing T cells for the process of negative selection. The three-dimensional network formed by these cells provides a physical platform for such selection. Together, mTECs hold a critical place in the maintenance of immune homeostasis, demonstrating the conceptual links that exist between population of stromal cells, thymocytes development, tissue-restricted antigen expression, and negative selection.

They are found within the columnar epithelium lining these organs, which forms a barrier between the internal body and the exterior environment.
A principal function of the respiratory goblet cell is the production and secretion of mucus, a carbohydrate-rich, viscous and gel-like substance that plays a critical role in trapping dust, bacteria, viruses, and other airborne particles that are inhaled. The mucus secreted by the goblet cells covers the lining of the respiratory tract, effectively catching these particles and preventing them from reaching the lungs and causing infection. Mucus also provides hydration and lubrication to the respiratory tract surfaces, which is important in maintaining the tissue's health and functioning.
In addition to their mucus-secreting capabilities, respiratory goblet cells also play a significant role in the body's inflammatory responses. When the respiratory system is exposed to irritants or pathogens, the number and activity of goblet cells often increase, leading to a higher production of mucus. This is a protective response designed to trap and neutralize the harmful substances more effectively. However, in conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, an overproliferation of goblet cells, also known as goblet cell hyperplasia, can lead to excessive mucus production and airway obstruction.

Further, some types of somatic cells work in a collaborative manner to form complex functional structures such as the skin and lining of the gut, demonstrating a higher level of organization. However, it's important to note that somatic cells are distinct from germ cells, which are responsible for sexual reproduction by forming sperm or eggs. Any alterations in the DNA of somatic cells, due to mutations, will not affect the offspring as they aren't involved in transmission of genetic information to the next generation. 
While most somatic cells contain two copies of each chromosome (diploid), a certain subset may possess a single set of chromosomes (haploid), specifically found in male ants, bees, and other hymenopterans. Hence, diversity is a defining characteristic of somatic cells, reflecting in their structures, roles, and genetic makeup.

Myotubes come to life through the fusion of myoblasts, which are undifferentiated mononucleated progenitor cells. In the early stages of embryonic muscle development, myoblasts proliferate rapidly under the influence of growth and differentiation factors. As myoblasts reach confluence, they withdraw from the cell cycle, align themselves with each other, increase expression of muscle-specific proteins, and ultimately fuse to form myotubes. The formation of myotubes heralds a critical transition, as this is when cells shift from proliferation and growth to differentiation and maturation.
Functionally, myotubes play a critical role in the formation and development of skeletal muscles. Myotubes gradually grow in size through the incorporation of additional myoblasts and eventually mature into muscle fibers, the contractile units of skeletal muscles. During this maturation process, myotubes polymerize their soluble muscle-specific proteins into myofibrils, which are essential for muscle contraction. Overall, myotubes are vital players in the complex process of muscle development and homeostasis.

Oligodendrocytes are known for their role in creating the protective myelin sheath that covers and insulates neurons in the central nervous system, enhancing the speed and efficiency of neurological signal transmission. OPCs contribute to this vital process by providing a consistent source of new oligodendrocytes.
OPCs are unique for their remarkable flexibility and adaptability, making them a critical element in many neurological processes. They are involved in neurogenesis and reparative functions as they can proliferate and be mobilized to areas of brain injury to aid in tissue repair and regeneration. Particularly, they play a significant role in the recovery and remyelination of damaged neurons, attributing to their prolific distribution in both gray and white matter areas of the brain and spinal cord.
Recent research has revealed the broader plasticity of OPCs. Studies have shown that OPCs can also differentiate into astrocytes and neurons under certain conditions, enlarging their role from just players in myelination to contributors in maintaining the integrity and adaptability of the central nervous system. Furthermore, these cells have been found to interact directly with neurons and take part in synaptic transmission, implying a more complex role in neural network activity.

Trophoblast giant cells are predominantly located at the fetal-maternal interface, where they aid in establishing the connection between the maternal blood supply and the embryonic circulatory system. This is achieved by the invasion and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries, a process carried out by a subset of these cells known as invasive trophoblast giant cells - a necessary step to ensure sufficient nutrient supply to the growing fetus. Additionally, these cells participate in the immune defense mechanism, secreting immunosuppressive molecules to protect against maternal immune rejection.
These cells are also the primary sources of progesterone, crucial for maintaining the uterine lining during pregnancy, and placental lactogen, which influences the mother's metabolic state to promote fetal growth. In essence, trophoblast giant cells serve as integral mediators, connecting the developmental needs of the fetus with the adaptive physiological changes in the mother.

These cells represent a substantial amount of the total lymphocyte pool and are most numerous in the intestine. They have distinct phenotypes and functional characteristics compared to lymphocytes residing in other tissues. 
Most intraepithelial lymphocytes express heterodimeric T-cell receptors (TCRs) consisting of αlpha and beta chains (TCRαβ), or less commonly gamma and delta chains (TCRγδ), together with the CD8 co-receptor (αβ or αα); there are also smaller subpopulations of IELs that areCD4+, or negative for both CD4 and CD8. Intraepithelial T cells typically express high levels of activation markers, tissue-homing integrins, and receptors and molecules characteristic of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. TCRαβ+CD8+ IEL are able to recognize both transformed self antigens via natural killer receptors and foreign antigen via the TCR.
The primary function of IELs is to maintain the integrity of mucosal barriers against pathogens. Given their strategic location within the epithelial layer, they are often the first immune cells that encounter invading infectious agents, such as bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Upon encountering pathogens, IELs activate and quickly respond by either directly killing the infected epithelial cells or alerting other immune cells. This rapid response, initiated by IELs, helps constrain the infection at the point of entry and is vital to maintaining the integrity of mucosal barriers. 
In addition to their central role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers, IELs also play a crucial role in maintaining the physiological health of the epithelia by promoting repair and regeneration after injury. Furthermore, IELs are pivotal in supporting oral tolerance to dietary antigens and gut microbiota. An imbalance in the number and functionality of IELs is often associated with various human diseases including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, and colorectal cancer.

Smooth muscle cells in the enteric system possess unique attributes that distinguish them from other smooth muscle cells in the body. One crucial function is peristalsis, where these cells contract in a coordinated manner, generating a wave of contraction and relaxation. This peristaltic movement facilitates the movement of food particles through the digestive tract, playing a vital role in the digestion and absorption processes in animals. Additionally, these cells are responsible for maintaining the tone of gastrointestinal sphincters, controlling passage and preventing one-sided movement of the contents.
Enteric smooth muscle cells are also involved in local immune responses of the gastrointestinal tract. They can communicate with local immune cells and secrete cytokines or other signaling molecules in response to infectious organisms, which makes them crucial mediocellular players in gastrointestinal homeostasis and response to disease. Their interactions with other cell types, such as neurons, myofibroblasts, and interstitial cells of Cajal, further contribute to these cells' role in maintaining the physiological functions of the gastrointestinal system.

The location of these cells varies with gender; typically, in males these cells are found in the area of the abdomen, whereas, in females, they are found in the thighs and the buttock region.
These cells play an integral role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Beyond energy storage, subcutaneous fat cells are also engaged in numerous physiological processes such as maintaining body temperature, protecting the body from mechanical trauma, and functioning as an endocrine organ. They produce and secrete various bioactive molecules known as adipokines which have wide-ranging impacts on various bodily processes, including regulation of appetite, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and immune function.
Subcutaneous fat cells have a characteristic shape, being large, spherical, and filled with a large lipid droplet, unlike other cell types that contain smaller lipid droplets scattered throughout the cytoplasm. The diameter of these cells can range from 30 to over 300 micrometers, significantly larger than most other cells in the body. Of note, these cells also demonstrate a unique property called plasticity. They are able to change their volume dramatically, expanding to store more fat as it is taken up from the bloodstream, and shrinking when fats are released to provide energy.

These specific cholangiocytes arise from bipotent hepatoblasts, whereas extrahepatic cholangiocytes share an embryologic origin with the ventral pancreas.
Recent research suggests that there is also heterogeneity within populations of intrahepatic cholangiocytes with different transcriptional profiles, proliferative capacity, and biological function; for example, subpopulations differ in calcium-mobilizing receptors.
The primary function of intrahepatic cholangiocytes is related to bile formation and maintenance of its flow. In addition to their secretory and absorptive activities, they are involved in the regulation of bile composition, volume, and alkalinization, contributing to the neutralization of the acidic chyme (partly digested food) that enters the intestine from the stomach. Intrahepatic cholangiocytes are also recognized for their role in liver regeneration and repair, often proliferating in response to injury. 
Intrahepatic cholangiocytes take part in certain pathological conditions, like primary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma.

Aortic smooth muscle cells play a vital role in maintaining blood pressure and circulation, and are essential for vascular integrity and function. The primary function of these cells is contraction and relaxation, which enables the regulation of blood flow and pressure in the aorta, and helps in the distribution of oxygen and nutrients throughout the body.
Additionally, a critical characteristic of smooth muscle cells is their plasticity. They can undergo phenotypic modulation in response to changes in their environment or vascular injury, switching from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. The contractile phenotype is characterized by high contractility and low proliferation rate, while the synthetic phenotype is marked by increased cell proliferation and matrix synthesis but reduced contractile function.
Aortic smooth muscle cells have a significant role in the physiological and pathological processes of the cardiovascular system.

Particularly notable is their role in cardiac response to injury, such as myocardial infarction, where they proliferate intensely, and subsequently differentiate into myofibroblasts, contributing to scar formation and remodeling of cardiac tissue post-injury.
Moreover, during pathological conditions of the heart, including cardiac fibrosis and heart failure, these fibroblasts can undergo phenotypic transformation into myofibroblasts, leading to an overproduction of ECM components and resulting in stiffening of the cardiac tissue. Over time, this diminishes the heart's ability to pump efficiently, sometimes leading to heart failure.

Some studies suggest that Schwann cells may regulate neuronal action potential, muscular contraction, and the sensitive response. 
While Schwann cells are most commonly known for the formation of the myelin sheath, some Schwann cells do not form myelin: Remak Schwann cells, a class of nonmyelinating Schwann cells, ensheath axons with smaller diameter, such as C fiber nociceptors in sciatic nerves and form Remak bundles.
Schwann cells are found along both motor and sensory neurons and are crucial for the advancement and recovery of peripheral nerve injuries, due to their capacity to support nerve regeneration. In cases of nerve injury, Schwann cells play a vital role in recovery by initiating Wallerian degeneration, a process in which the part of the axon distal to the injury site degrades and is then cleared away. Following this, Schwann cells can guide the regrowth of the nerve, providing a conducive environment for axon regeneration. They remodel themselves into a regenerative phenotype, proliferate, and organize themselves into bands of Büngner that provide physical and chemical guidance for the regrowths of axons. This function of Schwann cells in the repair and regeneration of nervous system highlights their therapeutic potential in peripheral nerve injury treatments.

The primary role of these cells revolves around their location within the retinal vascular system, forming the structure of the blood-retinal barrier, a subset of the larger blood-ocular barrier system. 
The endothelial cells are particularly involved in the growth of new retinal blood vessels from pre-existing ones (angiogenesis); this is critical in managing the amount of oxygen and essential nutrients delivered to the ocular tissues.  They are crucial for maintaining homeostasis in the retinal environment by controlling the exchange of molecules between the blood and the retina. Furthermore, they mediate immune cell trafficking, supporting the immune privilege of the eye by preventing the unrestricted infiltration of inflammatory cells into the retina, thus maintaining ocular health and normal vision.
The malfunction or dysfunction of retinal blood vessel endothelial cells is implicated in numerous ocular pathologies, particularly diabetic retinopathy, which is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. In such conditions, the compromise in the integrity of the blood-retinal barrier and excess angiogenesis can lead to retinal edema and pathological neovascularization, resulting in vision loss.

These pigment-laden cells are highly specialized and perform an array of metabolic and transport functions essential for the maintenance of the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) in the retina. The pigmentation of RPE cells actively aids in the absorption of excess light and the prevention of light scattering, thus enhancing the eye's optical properties.
The retinal pigment epithelium forms a key part of the blood/retina barrier. The cells have long sheet-like microvilli on their apical membrane that project into the light-sensitive outer segments of the photoreceptors, forming a close structural interaction. The basolateral membrane of the RPE interacts with the underlying Bruch’s membrane, which separates the RPE cells from fenestrated endothelium of the choriocapillaris. 
RPE cells support the photoreceptor by providing them with oxygen and nutrients (such as glucose, retinol and fatty acids) and removing waste products. They also recycle the visual pigment, in a process called the \"visual cycle\", where the RPE cells play a vital role in the regeneration of visual pigment (11-cis retinol) following the absorption of light. This is essential for the maintenance of photoreceptor excitability.
Beyond this, RPE cells take part in the phagocytosis process, where they digest the shed ends of photoreceptor outer segments, thus, preventing the build-up of waste residue that could otherwise harm retinal health. They also secrete various factors, including growth factors required to maintain the structural integrity of choriocapillaris endothelium and photoreceptors, as well as immunosuppressive factors that play an important role in establishing the immune privilege of the eye.

The unique structure of these cells, defined by fusiform shape and the absence of striations, sets them apart from other muscle cell types, including cardiac and skeletal.
The primary function of smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary artery is to regulate the diameter of the pulmonary artery, which in turn controls the flow of blood into the lungs. They accomplish this task through the contraction and relaxation, indicative of vasoconstriction and vasodilation respectively. When these cells contract, the diameter of the artery narrows, leading to reduced blood flow. Conversely, relaxation of these cells widens the artery, facilitating increased blood flow. Such blood flow modulation is crucial for the maintenance of blood pressure and ensuring that the lungs receive an adequate blood supply for efficient oxygen exchange.
As a result, abnormal function or proliferation of these cells can contribute to conditions such as pulmonary hypertension, a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs. This can occur due to hypoxia (lack of enough oxygen), leading to excessive constriction or proliferation of the smooth muscle cells.

They are characterized by their elongated spindle-shaped structure, with each cell containing a single central nucleus.
The primary function of bronchial smooth muscle cells is to control airway diameter, which directly influences the flow of air into and out of the lungs. Muscular contractions and relaxations mediated by these cells enable the bronchi to constrict or expand, facilitating the regulation of respiratory airflow. Additionally, these cells play a pivotal role in immune responses as they produce and release various substances that can instigate or lessen inflammation of airway tissue. Furthermore, bronchial smooth muscle cells can proliferate and lay down collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, contributing to the structural integrity of the bronchial tubes.
In pathological conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the function and biology of bronchial smooth muscle cells change. Asthma, for example, is associated with an abnormal increase in the mass of the bronchial smooth muscles, leading to narrowing of the airways and resultant breathing difficulties.

These cells play a key role in controlling the diameter of the trachea, thus regulating the airflow. They are responsible for the involuntary constriction and relaxation of the trachea influencing the air passage during various physiological behaviors like breathing, coughing, and sneezing. This autonomic control allows for adaptations to specific body requirements without conscious control, such as increasing air flow during exercise or restricting it during rest.

The mucinous type, more common in the submandibular and sublingual glands, contains mucin that aids in lubrication, facilitating the process of mastication and bolus formation.
Moreover, acinar cells also express and respond to various endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine hormones that govern the quantity and composition of the saliva produced. This implies sensitivity and modulation according to the internal and external environment, dietary habits, and even circadian rhythms. 
Impairment of acinar cells, whether due to damage or related to a systemic condition such as Sjögren's Syndrome, can disrupt the optimal functioning of the oral and digestive systems. In conclusion, acinar cells of the salivary gland have a substantial role in oral health and overall homeostasis.

Furthermore, these cells play a vital role in neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis, a response to trauma or neurodegenerative diseases, and assist in repairing damaged neural tissues. Thus, the versatile mature astrocytes play multiple roles and significantly contribute to the correct functioning and reparative process of the CNS.

Microglial cells serve as the primary immune defense mechanism within the CNS, playing active roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to pathological processes. In response to pathogens and injuries, microglial cells mature and change their morphology from a ramified shape with small processes (normal state) to an amoeboid shape (mature state).
Mature microglial cells possess multiple functional abilities, thereby enabling them to execute diverse roles in order to maintain the health of surrounding neural cells. They act to clear away cellular debris, dead neurons, or plaque formations through the process of phagocytosis. They are also continuously scanning their environment and are able to detect subtle changes in the neural landscape caused by injury, disease, or infection. Upon detection of such changes, these cells become activated and present antigens and secrete cytokines and chemokines to initiate an inflammation response, which sustains the brain’s defense against injurious agents.
Their role is not solely destructive or defensive: mature microglial cells also contribute to neurodevelopment by guiding the formation of neural circuits, synaptogenesis, and remodeling. Furthermore, they assist in managing synaptic plasticity, a key process in learning and memory functions. While the dysregulation of microglial cells has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, they are also regarded as potential therapeutic targets for such conditions, given their crucial roles in maintaining CNS health.

These cells exhibit a distinctive columnar shape and are attached directly to the basal lamina. They are characterized by the presence of high amounts of cytoplasmic keratins, predominantly keratin 5 and 14, and transcription factor tumor protein (tp63), which set them apart from other types of lung epithelial cells such as ciliated cells and secretory cells. 
Basal cells are essential for maintaining airway integrity. They make up one third of all respiratory epithelial cells and serve as stem cells as they can transform into different cell types, like goblet cells, ciliated cells, and club cells, when needed for homeostatic maintenance of the epithelial barrier or to repair and restore a healthy cellular environment after injury.
Their position at the interface between the internal environment and the external atmosphere makes these cells a first line of defense against air-borne irritants, allergens, and pathogens. Their robust, intrinsic reparative properties facilitate effective recovery from such adversities. However, damage to respiratory basal cells or abnormalities in their function are associated with several respiratory pathologies such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Therefore, understanding these cells' function, and their role in disease, is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies for respiratory disorders.

Vascular sprouting relies on the coordinated activity of migrating endothelial tip cells at the forefront and proliferating stalk cells that elongate the sprout. The process is tightly controlled by different growths factors: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor acts on endothelial cells, inducing them to become endothelial tip cells that initiate sprouting. After sprouting initiation, activation of Notch signaling suppresses differentiation toward a tip cell phenotype and some of the endothelial cells differentiate into stalk cells, which follow tip cells, multiply, and elongate to provide a structural backbone to the growing vessel sprout. 
In contrast to endothelial tip cells, which migrate and lead the angiogenic sprout, endothelial stalk cells behind the sprouts continue forming the tube or lumen for blood flow and facilitate maturation and stability of the new vessel. The delicate balance between the activities of stalk and tip cells during angiogenesis is crucial to build a functional vascular network. Dysfunctions in endothelial stalk cells can lead to pathological conditions such as impaired wound healing, unregulated tumor growth, and metastasis due to abnormal angiogenesis.

These cells play crucial roles in maintaining ion and acid-base homeostasis. Ionocytes demonstrate remarkable plasticity and are able to adapt themselves in response to changes in environmental conditions such as pH, salinity, ion concentration, and temperature.
These cells work by selectively absorbing specific ions from the environment, thus maintaining the body's internal ionic balance. The most commonly absorbed ions include sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca2+), and hydrogen (H+). Moreover, ionocytes contribute to acid-base regulation. In response to acidosis or alkalosis, ionocytes can either excrete or retain hydrogen (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions to readjust the blood pH. Further, experimental evidence suggests a functional complexity of ionocytes, implying diverse roles beyond ion regulation. Recent research highlights ionocytes' involvement in ammonia excretion and the regulation of extracellular fluid volume, highlighting their contribution to the overall homeostatic process.
Malfunctioning ionocytes have been implicated in various diseases, including cystic fibrosis which is caused by mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, an ionocyte marker.

A key function of renal principal cells is the regulation of water balance in the body. These cells express aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels, which facilitate the reabsorption of water from the fluid within the renal tubule lumen back into the blood. The translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane is controlled by the hormone vasopressin: In response to high vasopressin levels, AQP2 moves to the cell membrane, allowing water to pass through effectively and be reabsorbed, therefore concentrating the urine. Conversely, in low vasopressin conditions, AQP2 is removed from the membrane, reducing water reabsorption and diluting the urine. 
Renal principal cells are also involved in the regulation of sodium and potassium levels in the body. They have sodium channels (ENaC) in their luminal membranes which permit the reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubule fluid back into the blood, resulting in a net reabsorption of sodium ions into the systemic circulation. This process is controlled, in part, by the hormone aldosterone. Additionally, renal principal cells contain potassium channels that facilitate the secretion of potassium ions into the urine. The activities of these channels, in coordination with other cell types in the nephron, are critical for maintaining electrolyte balance and overall body homeostasis.

The primary role of intercalated cells is to reabsorb bicarbonate ions and secrete hydrogen ions, thereby maintaining the acid-base homeostasis in the blood. They comprise two main subtypes primarily distinguished by their functional and morphological attributes: alpha and beta intercalated cells.
Alpha intercalated cells are more predominant when the body is in a state of acidosis, a condition characterized by an increased acidity of the blood. These cells are specialized in secreting excessive hydrogen ions into the urine through a mechanism involving vacuolar H+-ATPase and H+/K+-ATPase pumps on their apical membranes. They simultaneously reabsorb bicarbonate ions from the tubular fluid and return them to the bloodstream via mechanisms involving carbonic anhydrase II and bicarbonate/chloride exchangers on the basolateral membrane. This dual process helps to increase blood pH towards normal levels.
When the body is in a state of alkalosis, a condition characterized by lowered levels of hydrogen ions in the blood, beta intercalated cells are more predominant. They primarily reabsorb hydrogen ions from the tubular fluid through vacuolar H+-ATPase and H+/K+-ATPase pumps on their basolateral membranes, while secreting bicarbonate ions into the urine via pendrin, a bicarbonate/chloride exchanger in the apical membrane.

The principal function of pancreatic epsilon cells involves the synthesis and release of the hormone ghrelin, a peptide hormone predominantly produced in the stomach; pancreatic epsilon cells are one of the few sites outside the gastrointestinal tract known to produce this hormone. Ghrelin has multiple vital roles, playing a significant part in generating hunger sensations, promoting fat storage, and influencing various metabolic processes. It also stimulates the release of Growth Hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland.
During fetal development, when they form a layer around the islet, epsilon cells are an important source of ghrelin, likely secreting the hormone into the circulation; their numbers decrease in adults. While research on pancreatic epsilon cells is still ongoing, these cells have been implicated in several disease states, most notably Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

These neurons regulate the motor functions of internal organs and glands, and serve as the effector neurons of the autonomic nervous system, conveying the signals from the central nervous system to execute actions.Visceromotor neurons are predominantly subdivided into two main functionally distinct categories: sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons.
Sympathetic visceromotor neurons tend to stimulate action, conserving energy for times of impending threat or when increased alertness is required. These neurons often act to increase heart rate, expand air passages allowing for greater oxygen flow to the muscles and brain, slow digestion, and produce a surge of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream to cater to the energy demands during periods of heightened activity or stress.
Parasympathetic visceromotor neurons typically take effect during periods of calm, and are responsible for what's often termed as \"rest and digest\" activities. They govern a variety of activities collectively aimed at restoring and conserving bodily energy. Parasympathetic visceromotor neurons act to conserve energy by slowing the heart rate, increasing intestinal and gland activity, and relaxing sphincter muscles in the gastrointestinal tract. The complementary functions of these two types of visceromotor neurons enable the body to maintain an overall balance, or homeostasis, responding appropriately under different conditions and demands. Without the dynamic and essential functioning of visceromotor neurons, the body would lose its capability to autonomously regulate essential processes, thereby exposing it to potentially harmful internal conditions.

During liver organogenesis hepatoblasts proliferate and migrate into the septum transversum to form the liver bud. Proliferation and differentiation of these cells are regulated by several soluble factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor, which is a mitogen of both hepatoblasts and mature hepatocytes. As they start to differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, the cells begin to express hepatic markers like albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. 
Although hepatoblasts are specified embryonic liver cells that are bipotential for hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, a subset of liver cells (called oval cells) has been identified in adults that express stem cell markers, such as CD133 and cKIT, and has been suggested to have the same potential as hepatoblasts to differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

They are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and are an intermediate stage marking the transition from an osteoprogenitor cell to a fully differentiated osteoblast. The presence of preosteoblasts signifies the site of new bone deposition, highlighting their crucial role in skeletal development and in response to bone injury repairs.
The primary function of preosteoblasts is to differentiate into osteoblasts, which are responsible for secreting osteoid (the unmineralized portion of bone matrix) and regulating the process of bone mineralization. Preosteoblasts are regulated by various growth factors and hormones, including bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Vitamin D.
However, the function of preosteoblasts is not limited to bone formation alone. In addition to osteogenesis, preosteoblasts significantly contribute to the maintenance of bone homeostasis through regulating the activity of osteoclasts - the cells responsible for bone resorption. This regulation is mediated through RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway signaling. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) released from the preosteoblasts acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL impairing osteoclast formation, hence preventing excessive bone resorption. This regulatory role indicates the dual functionality of preosteoblasts, which are indispensable for both the formation of new bone and the maintenance of existing bone tissue.

These unique cells constitute the principal component of the ENS, which is often referred to as the \"second brain\" or the gut's brain, due to its autonomy from the central nervous system (CNS). While the ENS does communicate with the CNS, it can function independently, thereby playing an essential role in maintaining the body's homeostasis.
Enteric neurons are incredibly diverse in function and morphology. Integral to essential processes like peristalsis, secretion, and blood flow regulation, these neurons are further classified into different types based on their roles. The organization of the ENS is characterized by two main ganglionated layers: the inner submucosal (Meissner's) plexus, involved primarily in regulating gastrointestinal blood flow and epithelial cell function, and the outer myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus, which predominantly manages gut motility.
Enteric neurons play a significant role in sensing and responding to changes within the gut environment. First, they detect physical and chemical changes, for instance, the arrival of food, and respond accordingly by adjusting gut motility and secretions. Second, they communicate information about the state of the gut to the CNS; however, much of the routine detailed management of the digestive system is carried out within the ENS itself. In addition, they also interact with the gut's large microbial population and the immune system, playing a pivotal role in health and disease. Dysfunctions or alterations in the enteric neurons may contribute to various gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.

Mesenchymal cells play a critical role in the development and maintenance of various biological systems throughout the body due to their versatility and adaptability. They can differentiate into more specialized cells, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, which are essential for bone, fat, and cartilage tissues, respectively. Furthermore, they contribute to the vascular and lymphatic systems through the formation of pericytes and lymphatic endothelial cells, securing the integrity of the circulatory system.
In the field of regenerative medicine, mesenchymal cells, particularly mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are of great interest due to their unique therapeutic potential. MSCs, for instance, have been implicated in wound healing and tissue repair because of their capacity to modulate the immune response. They can secrete a range of proteins and growth factors that aid in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and the stimulation of resident progenitor cells to aid in tissue restoration.

Functionally, enteroendocrine cells play a pivotal role in the gut-endocrine system, which is responsible for the digestive process. These cells translate the luminal nutrient status into hormonal signals thereby acting as chemosensors. They contain secretory granules at their base which release hormones into the bloodstream following chemo-sensation. The hormones they secrete perform diverse functions including regulating gastric secretion, gut motility, insulin release, appetite control and other local and systemic effects. 
In addition to their endocrine functions, enteroendocrine cells also play a part in the modulation of the immune response in the gut. They can secrete cytokines and chemokines that have a role in directing the immune response to invading pathogens. Moreover, emerging research suggests that these cells play a role in maintaining the balance between gut resident bacteria, known as the gut microbiota, and the host.

Under disease conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, Paneth cells increase in numbers in the colon. They reside in the crypts of Lieberkühn, which are glandular structures embedded within the mucosal layer of the small and large intestine. 
Paneth cells play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and acting as a frontline of defense in our bodies against ingested microbes. They achieve this through the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and proteins such as lysozyme and defensins, which can directly kill or inhibit the growth of various bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They degranulate these substances into the intestinal lumen, especially under conditions of pathogenic invasion or damage to the epithelial lining. 
Moreover, Paneth cells are essential for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells, which continually replace the epithelium of the intestine. They create a niche for these stem cells at the base of the crypts, secreting various signaling molecules and factors that are essential for the growth and differentiation of intestinal stem cells. In essence, the existence and function of Paneth cells are fundamental to the overall gut health and immune defense system, by providing both antimicrobial functions and a conducive environment for the renewal of the intestinal lining. 
The role of Paneth cells specifically in the colon is of interest in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease: Their presence in the colon is thought to represent Paneth cell metaplasia and indicates a chronic inflammatory state.

TACs of the small intestine are primarily present in the crypt-villus structure of the intestine, more specifically in the crypt region. They originate from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells that reside at the base of the crypts. Following their derivation from stem cells, TACs undergo up to six rounds of rapid division over a 48-72 hour period, effectively amplifying the cell population, hence their name. During this process, they gradually migrate upward along the walls of the crypt from where they differentiate into diverse mature cell types such as enterocytes, goblet cells, and Paneth cells. 
TACs serve as an important element in the homeostasis and regeneration of the intestinal epithelium, amplifying the pool of cells available for differentiation. They also minimize genetic errors during DNA replication by serving as a 'buffer zone' between the long-lived stem cells and the terminal differentiated cells of the gut lining, thus reducing the potential for propagation of mutation-causing defects. Lastly, TACs play an essential part in gastrointestinal tissue repair following injury or inflammation.

They possess self-renewal ability, an essential feature of stem cells, which allows them to maintain a steady population in the small intestine.
One of the critical roles of intestinal crypt stem cells is to drive the continual renewal process taking place in the small intestine every 3-5 days.

Intestinal macrophages represent the largest group of macrophages in the body and play a key role as sentinels for pathogen recognition and elimination. Because the gastrointestinal tract is continually exposed to a high antigenic load derived from microbes and food intake, macrophages in the intestines are crucial not only for the gut’s immune defense but also for maintaining gastrointestinal homeostasis, avoiding chronic inflammation despite constantly facing foreign antigens. The phenotypic profiles and cytokine production of intestinal macrophages therefore differ from conventional macrophages elsewhere in the body. 
Colon macrophages orchestrate a wide variety of immune responses. They interact with the colon’s microflora thanks to their location in the mucosal layer, thus playing an important role in shaping gut immunity. By presenting antigens, they help to activate and steer an appropriate immune response either by triggering inflammation against harmful pathogens or by supporting tolerance for beneficial microbes. Therefore, disturbances in the colon macrophage population is thought to contribute to colon-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. 
These immune cells are versatile and multifunctional, not just limited to defensive actions. Colon macrophages interact with the enteric nervous system to regulate gut secretion and motility.

In the colon, goblet cells continuously renew the inner mucus layer, which is attached and impervious to bacteria (the outer layer of the colon is unattached and is the habitat of commensal bacteria)

The mucus layer not only provides a provides a protective barrier against pathogen invasion, as well as mechanical damage, and the erosive effects of digestive enzymes, it also acts as a lubricant to facilitate the passage of food material.
Colon goblet cells are also involved in regulating the local immune response within the gut, maintaining the delicate balance between necessary immune reactions to harmful pathogens and tolerance to beneficial microbiota and dietary substances. Goblet cells can modulate immune responses by presenting antigens to dendritic cells, as well as through the production of immunomodulatory molecules that can alter the behavior of immune cells. When the inner mucus layer of the colon is defective, it might be a pathophysiological mechanism for colitis and infectious diseases.

They were named for their unique appearance under an electron microscope, which presents a distinctive ‘tuft-like’ morphology. They are characterized by apical microvilli, arranged in an irregular tuft that confers a dome-like shape. These cells comprise only a small fraction of the cells in the epithelial layer of the colon, making them among the least populous cell types in this region.
Tuft cells in the colon primarily function as chemosensory cells that can sense and respond to environmental changes. These cells can detect and respond to microbial metabolites, helping initiate immune responses against potential threats. 
Recent studies have revealed that tuft cells play a role in responding to intestinal parasitic infections. When a gastrointestinal parasite infects the colon, tuft cells are activated and release the cytokine IL-25. This action increases the production of tuft cells and triggers essential Th2 immune responses to expel the parasites. Also, the removal of tuft cells has been linked to increased susceptibility to these infections. However, overactivity of tuft cells has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting the need for a delicate balance of tuft cell function to maintain colon homeostasis.

The prime function of intestinal crypt stem cells of the colon is to serve as the source of constant cell regeneration in the colon. Every few days, these stem cells divide and differentiate into the various other types of intestinal cells, such as enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells. 
A constant renewal cycle is necessary due to the harsh environment of the colon where cells continuously encounter abrasive food matter and potential pathogens, leading to a high turnover rate. When the colon's mucosal layer suffers damage, a rapid response is triggered whereby colon crypt stem cells divide faster and are directed to injured sites to repair the epithelial layer. Dysregulation of these cells' function or proliferation can contribute to disorders such as colorectal cancer.

Additionally, they control the trafficking of white blood cells into the myocardium, playing a vital role in immune surveillance and response to pathogens.
An important feature of cardiac blood vessel endothelial cells is their contribution to vessel tone and blood pressure regulation. Endothelial cells release nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, which helps to modulate blood vessel diameter as per the cardiac demands and maintain homeostasis. Moreover, these cells are active participants in the blood clotting process by expressing a variety of proteins and receptors that interact with platelets and plasma clotting factors.
In pathological conditions, the function of cardiac blood vessel endothelial cells can change dramatically, leading to various cardiovascular diseases. In response to injury or disease, these cells can proliferate and migrate contributing to vessel repair or aberrant remodelling, promote inflammation, and contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.

The primary function of cortical neurons is to manage and interpret the sensory input being received by the brain, generating suitable motor output responses. They play a critical role in processing information and communication within the brain. These neurons are involved in the exchange of direct synaptic communication with thousands of other neurons. Due to the wide extent of their dendritic and axonal arbors, these neurons present a broad receptive field for incoming information and an expansive projecting field to convey integrated information.
Cortical neurons further define the functional structure of the cerebral cortex by their type and connection. They can be broken down into two categories: excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons. The excitatory projection neurons are the principal neurons of the cerebral cortex and utilize glutamate as a neurotransmitter. They form the connections between the cerebral cortex and other brain regions, hence their tag as \"projection\" neurons. Conversely, inhibitory interneurons are local to the cerebral cortex and use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter, serving to regulate the activity of the projection neurons. Through these intricate interconnections, cerebral cortex neurons play a significant role in the higher cognitive functions of the human brain.

GABAergic neurons are particularly important for maintaining homeostasis within the brain, and any imbalance in GABAergic neurotransmission is often associated with neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and mood disorders, highlighting their significance in the nervous system.
The primary function of GABAergic interneurons is to inhibit neural transmission or modulate the degree of activation of other neurons. They achieve this task by releasing GABA neurotransmitter, which binds to GABA receptors on other cells, resulting in a decrease of neuronal excitability. They form extensive circuits and are intricately involved in various neural processes including learning and memory, sensory perception, and motor control among others. Additionally, subsets of GABAergic interneurons serve as pacemakers in various brain rhythms thus contributing to cognitive processes such as attention and sensory perception.
GABAergic interneurons are not a homogenous group, they vary in terms of morphology, distribution, and function in the brain. For example, interneurons in the hippocampus regulate the transmission of information by inhibiting the flow of excitatory signals as part of a feedback loop. Other types, found predominantly in the cerebral cortex (like basket cells), exert control over a larger network of cells. Thus, despite being inhibitory in nature, their impact on neuronal circuitry broadens the diversity of information flow within the brain, hence potentiating information processing and ensuring proper nervous system function.

Following injury, they proliferate and transform into myofibroblasts, aiding wound contraction and depositing new ECM for tissue repair. Additionally, these fibroblasts modulate inflammatory responses by secreting cytokines and interact with other cell types, like immune cells and satellite cells, to coordinate muscle healing. In diseases, an imbalance in SMF activity may lead to conditions such as fibrosis, marked by excessive ECM deposition and impaired muscle function.

As a significant component of the placenta, the chorion forms the external fetal-maternal interface and consists primarily of chorionic trophoblast cells. These cells are pivotal in embryogenesis, fetal nutrition, waste removal, and immune response generation, contributing crucially to the success of pregnancy.
Chorionic trophoblast cells undergo trophoblast differentiation, giving rise to specialized sub-types: cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Cytotrophoblasts, found in the inner layer, serve as stem cells and contribute to proliferative activities. In contrast, syncytiotrophoblasts, originating from cytotrophoblasts, form the outer layer with a distinctive multinucleated, continuous, and non-proliferative structure. These cells play a key role in maternal-fetal gas and nutrient exchange, producing essential hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone, and estrogen, vital for sustaining pregnancy.
Apart from their physiological roles, chorionic trophoblast cells play a crucial role in shielding the fetus from the maternal immune system. They accomplish this by modifying the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which are self-identifying proteins utilized by the immune system to identify foreign cells. Through selective expression of specific types of these molecules, trophoblast cells can evade cytotoxic T cells that might otherwise attack them, while still retaining the ability to attract natural killer cells. These natural killer cells assist in trophoblast invasion and the remodeling of blood vessels in the uterus.

They play a critical role in the body's 'fight or flight' responses and are primarily involved in regulating involuntary physiological processes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and metabolic processes. These neurons are essential for homeostatic mechanisms, working to ensure a balanced state is maintained within the body amidst changing environments.
Structurally, sympathetic neurons are characterized by their relatively long axons, which allow them to relay signals from the central nervous system to various peripheral organs and tissues. They typically originate within the spinal cord's thoracic and lumbar regions, extending their axons to connect with various targets, including cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and glands. These neurons often utilize noradrenaline (norepinephrine) as a neurotransmitter, which binds to adrenergic receptors on the target cells to exert their effects.
Functionally, the sympathetic neurons help the body respond to stressful or threatening situations. When activated, they provoke a cascade of processes that ready the body for quick action. This includes accelerating the heart rate, dilating the pupils, slowing digestion, and increasing blood flow to muscles. Conversely, when the threat has passed, they encourage a return to normalcy by inhibiting these same processes. Beyond this 'fight or flight' response, sympathetic neurons also function to help regulate body temperature by inducing sweating or shivering, influence the dilation of blood vessels to control blood pressure, and can stimulate the release of glucose from the liver to provide energy. Overall, sympathetic neurons are key mediators of the body's response to various internal and external stimuli, maintaining homeostasis and preparing the body for diverse challenges.

These cells are primarily located in the ventricular zone of the developing forebrain, which is composed of the cerebrum and the diencephalon. Radial glial cells are named for their unique morphology, specifically their elongated cell bodies, which extend radially from the ventricular surface to the pial surface, acting as a scaffold for newborn neurons to migrate along during the development of the brain.
Functionally, forebrain radial glial cells serve as both progenitor cells and guide cells for neurons. They proliferate to increase their population and produce neurons or glial cells through asymmetric division, contributing to the complexity and diversity of cell types in the brain. During neurogenesis, an important process in brain development, radial glial cells provide physical and biochemical guidance to newborn neurons, helping them migrate from their birthplace in the ventricular zone to their final destination in the cortical plate.
Furthermore, forebrain radial glial cells play a critical role in the formation of the cerebral cortex layers through their interaction with newborn neurons. They are involved in the establishment of the six-layered architecture of the cerebral cortex, crucial to higher cognitive functions, sensory processing, and control of motor behavior. After completing their roles in neurogenesis and the formation of cortical layers, most radial glial cells transform into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, the main glial cell types in the mature brain. Thus, from their contribution to the proliferation and differentiation of neurons to the establishment of cortical layering, forebrain radial glial cells perform several fundamental roles in brain development.

The main responsibility of the pulmonary ionocyte pertains to the regulation and mobilization of chloride ions. They express a high level of CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene, which encodes a protein channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes. The activity of CFTR regulates the movement of chloride ions and fluids in and out of cells, which helps maintain a balance of fluid in the organs they are expressed in. If CFTR is dysfunctional, it can cause conditions such as cystic fibrosis, characterized by thick, sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and obstruct the pancreas, leading to respiratory and digestive issues.
The discovery of this cell type offers new doors to the treatment and further understanding of diseases like cystic fibrosis. Increased understanding of pulmonary ionocytes could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to manipulate the function of CFTR in the lungs and other organs affected by dysfunctional CFTR.

These cells form a major part of the liver's cellular architecture and play a pivotal role in detoxification, metabolism, and homeostasis processes in the human body. 
Periportal hepatocytes differ functionally from hepatocytes in the liver’s midzone (zone 2) and the pericentral zone 3. They are exposed to higher oxygen concentrations than hepatocytes in zones 2 and 3 because they are closer to the portal triads where oxygen-rich blood enters the liver. They therefore catalyze predominantly oxidative energy metabolism. 
Periportal hepatocytes are responsible for gluconeogenesis, the process by which glucose is synthesized from smaller precursor molecules like lactate, glycerol and glucogenic amino acids, to maintain blood glucose levels, particularly during fasting periods. Additionally, they carry out cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, urea synthesis, and the conversion of ammonia to urea, aiding in the detoxification and excretory functions necessary to maintain homeostasis. Periportal hepatocytes are also associated with bile synthesis and secretion, given their proximity to the bile duct. Bile components facilitate the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids and the removal of waste products from the liver. 
Because of their location near the portal triad periportal hepatocytes are more resistant to ischemic injury than other hepatocytes but are more susceptible to toxic damage due to their higher exposure to drugs and toxins.

These cells are a specialized subgroup of smooth muscle cells, specifically found in the layers of the small intestine. The small intestine represents a significant part of the digestive system and plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.
Smooth muscle cells of the small intestine are predominantly responsible for creating the contractions and relaxations that constitute intestinal motility. They trigger these movements in a coordinated and rhythmic manner known as peristalsis and segmentation. Peristalsis is a form of longitudinal and sequential contraction that pushes food from the upper gastrointestinal tract to the lower parts. Segmentation works by squeezing the intestine randomly, thereby facilitating the mixing of food particles and increasing contact with absorptive surfaces. These two processes are critical for intestinal motility and an effective digestive process.
Apart from facilitating transit of food through contractions, these smooth muscle cells play a role in controlling the diameter of the vessels and the blood flow in the small intestine by their constrictive ability. These smooth muscle cells also contribute to the structural integrity of the small intestine by forming a part of its muscularis externa and muscularis mucosae. Additionally, they interact with other cell types such as enteric neurons and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), forming an integrated cellular network that ensures optimal functioning of the intestinal tract.

Distinguished from skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, smooth muscle does not possess striations and is under the control of the involuntary nervous system. 
These cells primarily facilitate the movement of digested food, a process known as peristalsis. These cells coordinate rhythmic contractions and relaxations, propelling the chyme toward the colon. This process is vital for efficient nutrient absorption in the small intestine and the transfer of undigested material to the large intestine. Moreover, the smooth muscle fibers enhance the ileum's ability to expand and adapt to volume changes without elevating internal pressure, known as compliance.
The smooth muscle fiber of the ileum contributes to reflex responses, enhancing muscle contractions to propel intestinal contents in different physiological conditions. This involves intricate molecular signaling with neurotransmitters, hormones, and local signals. Thus, beyond its structural role, the smooth muscle fiber is crucial for the physiological functions of digestion and absorption in the small intestine.

The type of epithelial cells found in the urethra can vary along its length. In general, the urethra is lined with stratified squamous epithelium in its distal or external portion, which is closer to the external environment. This type of epithelium provides protection against mechanical stress and pathogens. Closer to the bladder, the urethra transitions to a different type of epithelium. In males, the proximal part of the urethra is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium in the region where it passes through the prostate gland. In females, the transitional epithelium may be present in the proximal part of the urethra near the bladder.
Epithelial cells of the urethra are primarily dedicated to the protection of underlying tissues from mechanical stress and pathogens during micturition (urination). They do this by creating a tight, impermeable barrier that prevents the entry and colonization of invading microbes. They produce a variety of antimicrobials and are tightly packed to prevent infiltration between cells, forming an integral part of the body's innate immune system.
In addition to their protective role, these cells are involved in the secretion of mucus. This mucus acts as a lubricant that ensures the smooth and easy passage of urine from the bladder through the urethra and out of the body, reducing any potential damage from the erosive action of urine. Epithelial cells of the urethra are dynamic, constantly renewing their numbers to replace any cells lost through wear and tear. Any disruptions to the function or integrity of these cells may contribute to urinary tract infections and other urological disorders.

Fibroblasts, in general, are ubiquitous in the body's connective tissues, playing vital roles in wound healing and tissue repair. However, within the prostate, these cells exhibit unique characteristics targeted at the organ's health and function, permitting dynamic interactions with other cell types and fostering tissue architecture.
Fibroblasts found in the prostate contribute significantly to the organ's function, particularly in maintaining tissue health and structure. These cells synthesize major structural proteins, such as collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans—components of the extracellular matrix that provide structural support to the prostate tissue. This ensures the prostate's smooth muscle maintains its capability to contract and expand, thereby enabling proper function during urination and ejaculation. Furthermore, as the prostate gland undergoes adaptive alterations in response to ageing, fibroblasts play an integral role in coordinating these changes through their ability to modulate the extracellular matrix.
Beyond maintaining tissue structure, the fibroblast of connective tissue of the prostate also participates actively in paracrine signaling—communication with other cell types within the prostate. Such cross-talk is especially significant in settings of inflammation, tissue injury, and in the pathogenesis of diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. In disease states, these fibroblasts can transition to a reactive phenotype characterized by increased proliferation and secretion of growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This transition excessively modulates the extracellular matrix, contributing to the diseased state.

Being the most abundant cell type in the prostate stroma, fibroblasts are responsible for the production and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) via synthesis of collagen and elastin, structural proteins that provides crucial supportive and adhesive framework for the glandular elements of the prostate. These proteins provide tensile strength and elasticity, respectively, contributing to the healthy architecture of the prostate tissue. These cells also play a significant role in coordinating intercellular communication within the prostate by interacting with adjacent epithelial cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, and nerve cells, affecting cell growth, differentiation, and function.
Prostatic stromal fibroblasts are actively involved in modulating local immune responses and tissue repair. Acting as local immunomodulatory cells, they can secrete a variety of cytokines and chemokines, influencing the functions of immune cells in the prostate microenvironment. Similarly, under pathological conditions, such as tissue injury or inflammation, these fibroblasts can transition into a more activated state, known as myofibroblasts, driving wound healing and tissue remodeling processes. It's worth noting that aberrant activation and proliferation of these fibroblasts can contribute to pathological situations, such as prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, underscoring their importance in both health and disease.

Epicardial adipocytes store energy in the form of lipids; specifically, triglyceride droplets. These cells can rapidly mobilize and release these fatty acid molecules, when required, providing an effective and efficient energy source to the body. This energy is particularly important to the heart, which is one of the highest energy-demanding organs. The proximity of these specialized cells to the myocardium allows for direct and rapid transmission of these fatty acid molecules to meet the heart’s energy needs. 
Beyond their primary role in energy storage and regulation, epicardial adipocytes also play a pivotal role in providing a protective cushioning to the heart, releasing several beneficial adipokines which impacts cardiac function, along with acting as a source of stem cells. Adipocytes also contribute significantly to cardiac health and function in other ways. They have been found to secrete multiple bioactive molecules, known as adipokines, which can influence local cardiac function and overall cardiovascular health. Adipokines such as adiponectin, leptin and resistin regulate aspects of cardiac metabolism, inflammation, and contractility. Additionally, studies have also pointed towards epicardial adipocytes as a potential reservoir of adult epicardial progenitor cells, which can give rise to smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and more adipocytes, thus contributing to cardiac repair and regeneration. Despite these important functions, an excess of epicardial adipose tissue has been associated with cardiovascular disease, indicating the importance of understanding and managing the balance of these unique cells in the body.

The key function of goblet cells is the production and secretion of a protective layer of mucus which is essential for maintaining gut homeostasis. Goblet cells have a characteristic 'goblet-like' shape, which adapts them for this specific function: organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, ER, and Golgi apparatus are located in the basal portion of the cell; while the vesicles with mucins (required for mucus production) are located apically, close to the apical membrane where their exocytosis takes place.
The goblet cells of the large intestine produce a thick layer of mucus that coats the intestinal lumen. This mucus provides a barrier that prevents the direct contact of intestinal cells with bacteria and other potentially toxic substances present in the digestive tract. It also lubricates the intestine to facilitate the smooth passage of digested food material. It is worth noting that the mucus system differs between the small and large intestine: although in both the mucus is built around MUC2 mucin polymers produced by goblet cells, it is becoming clear that there are several types of goblet cells that function in different ways. 
From an immunological perspective, large intestine goblet cells participate in promoting a balanced gut immune response. They contribute to the process known as immune tolerance, where they prevent the body's immune system from overreacting to the trillions of bacteria present in the gut. These cells achieve this by secreting molecules that help maintain a calm environment, limiting inflammatory reactions unless absolutely necessary. Any dysfunction or decrease in the number of goblet cells can result in a compromised intestinal barrier leading to various health issues, including inflammatory bowel disease.

Their strategic location in the ileal segment of the intestinal tract aids in efficient nutrient absorption while also maintaining an impregnable barrier against potential pathogens, ensuring an intricate balance.
Goblet cells of the ileum also play a significant role in immune modulation. They are thought to promote oral tolerance (the immune unresponsiveness to orally ingested antigens such as food) by delivering luminal antigens to underlying dendritic cells, thereby driving immune education and tolerogenic responses. They also secrete bioactive molecules, such as the trefoil factor peptide TFF3, which aids in repairing damaged epithelium. By performing these crucial functions, ileal goblet cells not only aid in maintaining intestinal health, but also contribute significantly to the overall well-being of the organism.

Goblet cells specialize in the production and secretion of mucus, a slimy substance composed primarily of glycoproteins (mucins) and water. This sticky mucus serves to trap foreign particles and pollutants, such as dust, bacteria, and viruses that an organism breathes in. After trapping these particles, the cilia on neighboring ciliated epithelial cells beat synchronously, forming a coordinated escalator to push mucus upwards toward the pharynx, where it's either swallowed or expectorated. This system, known as the mucociliary clearance or escalator, forms a crucial barrier in the lungs against respiratory pathogens and external insults.
Changes in the number or function of tracheal goblet cells can engender health complications. For example, goblet cell hyperplasia, or excessive growth of goblet cells, is a common feature of chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

These cells are known for their production and release of serous secretions, which form a key component of airway mucus. These secretions primarily comprise of water, proteins, and enzymes, such as lysozyme and peroxidases. Their main purposes are to provide hydration and lubrication to the airway tissue and to act as a defense mechanism against pathogens. While the lysozyme and peroxidases contribute to the destruction of bacteria, the water in the secretions helps to liquefy the mucus, facilitating the effective functioning of the ciliated cells that propel the mucus up the trachea.
The coordinated action between serous cells and other cell types in the tracheal epithelium proves essential for maintaining a healthy respiratory tract. Dysfunction or damage of these cells can lead to various respiratory tract disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and asthma.

Additionally, they secrete several growth factors like EGF, TGF-alpha, and Wnt3, which are crucial for stem cell support and the overall maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity.
The unique location of Paneth cells at the base of the crypts positions them in very close proximity to intestinal stem cells. This not only facilitates their role in stem cell maintenance but also involves them in epithelial regeneration and repair following injury. Dysfunctional Paneth cells have been associated with several gut disorders, like Crohn’s disease and necrotizing enterocolitis.

M cells play a crucial role in the immune response within the intestine environment. 
These cells are characterized by microfolds (short microvilli, which give them their name), a reduced, thin glycocalyx, and a deeply invaginated basolateral membrane next to immune cells such as B cells, T cells, and macrophages, and DCs. 
These features allow the M cells to form the first point of contact between the gut lumen and the intestinal immune system. They are well-regulated gateways that capture and transport antigens, such as bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances found in the lumen, to the underlying cells of the immune system. This specialized transport mechanism, called ‘transcytosis’, involves engulfment of these antigens from the apical side, transport across their cytoplasm, and release on the basolateral side of the cells, where immune responses can be initiated. 
Furthermore, M cells have complex interactions with members of the gut microbiota and other immune cells, making them essential for maintaining gut homeostasis. This cross-talk shapes the diversity and makeup of the gut microbiota, subsequently having a substantial impact on the host's health. In certain situations, pathogenic organisms can exploit the transcytosis mechanism to infiltrate the host's system, causing various infectious diseases.
The overarching significance of M cells in the small intestine lies in their role of surveillance and protection against a wide range of potentially harmful pathogens, while also facilitating beneficial interactions with commensal microbes.

Depending on the location, the conjunctival epithelium varies from a stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium (close to the lid margin) to a stratified columnar epithelium (bulbar). It consists of between two and seven layers of epithelial cells, which are organized into three main types: basal, intermediate and superficial; amongst them are goblet cells, which produce the mucous layer of the tear film, 
The conjunctival cells play a vital role in preserving the health and functionality of the eye, contributing significantly to ocular defense mechanisms. They also participate in maintaining the ocular surface's physiological environment. Specifically, conjunctival epithelial cells serve as a physical barrier against environmental threats, such as dust, allergens, and microbes. They prevent foreign bodies from entering the eye, thanks to their tightly packed arrangement, which is integral to the eye's first line of defense. 
Apart from this physical protection, these conjunctival epithelial cells are also involved in immune defense. They secrete microbicidal and immunomodulatory peptides and cytokines and can recognize and respond to pathogens through their Toll- and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways and modulate DC and lymphocyte function. 
Additionally, conjunctival goblet cells, assist in maintaining ocular surface moisture by secreting soluble mucins for tear film production, a thin fluid layer that keeps the cornea and conjunctiva moist. This tear film lubricates the eye, protects against infections, and ensures uninterrupted, clear vision.

These cells form a ring around the iris, the eye's colored part. Ciliary muscle cells fall into the category of smooth muscle cells, characterized by their lack of the striations typical of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Their shape is elongated and pointed at both ends, and they occur in multi-nucleated syncytia where many cells share the same cytoplasm.
Ciliary muscle cells primarily control the eye's accommodation, adjusting the thickness and curvature of the lens to fine-tune the focus of light on the retina. When ciliary muscle cells contract, tension on the zonular fibers holding the lens in place is reduced, allowing the lens to become thicker and increase its refractive power. Conversely, when the ciliary muscle cells relax, the tension on the zonular fibers increases, causing the lens to become flatter and decrease its refractive power. This adjustment facilitates clear vision at different distances, ranging from near to far objects.
Additionally, ciliary muscle cells play a role in draining the eye's aqueous humor, which is the clear fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye between the cornea and the lens. By controlling the shape of the surrounding trabecular meshwork through muscle contractions and relaxations, ciliary muscle cells indirectly regulate intraocular pressure, a factor critical for preventing ocular conditions like glaucoma.

These cells are renowned for their proliferative potential. When the superficial layers of the esophageal epithelium are damaged, these basal cells are triggered to multiply, differentiate, and migrate upwards to restore the integrity and function of the affected tissue. This process, known as regeneration or repair, ensures that the esophageal wall remains continuous and functional, capable of performing its primary task: the conveyance of food and drink from the mouth to the stomach.
However, it's crucial to recognize that the continuous cycle of damage and repair in the esophageal epithelium, driven by the epithelial cells of the stratum germinativum, can result in pathological conditions like Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer. Under certain conditions, these basal cells may deviate from their normal differentiation into squamous cells and instead transform into abnormal cell types, such as intestinal columnar cells, contributing to the development of these diseases.

They form the main structure of the sweat glands, which are effectively long, coiled tubes located in the dermis. There are two types of sweat glands – eccrine glands, which typically open directly onto the skin surface (e.g. on palms and soles), and apocrine glands, which open onto associated hair follicles (e.g. in arm pits).  
Eccrine glands consist of a tube-shaped duct that ends in a coiled, secretory unit made up of three types of epithelial cells – dark, clear and myoepithelial. The dark cells contain basophilic granules to secrete sialomucin, while clear cells secrete glycogen-containing aqueous material; the myoepithelial cells contract in response to stimuli to assist with secretion. Apocrine glands have a similar structure, but their secretory component is larger. 
The primary function of the epithelial cells of these glands is to produce sweat, a bodily fluid made mostly of water, but also containing trace amounts of salts, glucose, urea, and other substances. This process begins with the secretion of a primary sweat fluid - an isotonic solution derived from the blood plasma - into the glandular lumen. Subsequently, as this primary sweat passes through the gland's duct, reabsorption of sodium ions occurs, leading to a hypotonic final sweat that is excreted onto the skin's surface. This sweat evaporates, removing heat from the body and thus, cooling it down. 
In addition, epithelial cells of sweat glands contribute to the body's immune defense system. As part of the innate skin barrier function, they secrete antimicrobial peptides and proteins, such as dermcidin, which can inhibit the growth of harmful microorganisms on the skin surface. They also aid in maintaining skin pH and contribute to fluid balance by regulating water resorption. Consequently, any dysfunction in these cells can lead to conditions like hyperhidrosis, anhidrosis, and certain skin infections. Thus, these epithelial cells of sweat glands play a multifaceted role in health and disease.

Each kidney holds approximately one million nephrons, each of which is composed of several distinct parts, including the renal corpuscle, the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal tubule. All sections are lined with highly specialized epithelial cells adapted to perform different functions within the sections of the nephron. 
The different epithelial cells of the nephron play crucial roles in the process of filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, essential tasks for the regulation of body fluid composition and volume. During filtration, the blood is forced through the walls of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule, where waste products, electrolytes, and water are separated from the blood cells and proteins. As the filtrate then passes through the nephron, epithelial cells of the tubular portion reabsorb useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, along with most of the water back into the bloodstream. Waste products like urea and creatinine, as well as excess ions and water, remain in the tubule for elimination.
In addition, epithelial cells of the nephron also play a vital part in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by actively secreting hydrogen ions into the urine while reabsorbing bicarbonate from the urine back into the blood. They are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and contribute to erythrocyte production by releasing the hormone erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. Abnormalities or damage in renal epithelial cells often result in impaired kidney function, leading to various renal diseases.

They are scattered among other columnar cells in the small intestine lining and form a vital part of the intestinal villi—tiny, finger-like projections that boost the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine. The name ‘goblet cell’ is derived from the cell's distinctive goblet shape, which features a broad apex and a narrow base.
The primary function of the small intestine goblet cells is to secrete mucus, a thick and lubricating substance that plays a crucial role in the body's defense mechanisms. This mucus layer, formed through the aggregation of individual mucin glycoproteins produced by goblet cells and secreted from vesicles located near the apical membrane, provides a protective lining that safeguards the epithelial cells of the intestine from corrosive substances and pathogenic organisms. Moreover, the mucin layer helps in the smooth passage of food material along the digestive tract.
Additionally, goblet cells in the small intestine contribute significantly to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. They actively engage in signal transduction pathways initiated by the native microflora and food antigens, modulating immune responses and preventing inflammation and autoimmunity. The mucus layer also functions as the habitat for beneficial bacteria, thereby facilitating a symbiotic relationship and promoting overall gut health. Any dysfunction or abnormality affecting these cells, such as depletion or hyperplasia, may potentially lead to severe gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.

These cells play a significant role in maintaining kidney structure and orchestrating key physiological procedures related to kidney function. The interstitium forms a complex network with other cells, capillaries, and the renal tubules, which are crucial for maintaining kidney functions.
Functionally, these cells participate in renal homeostasis by synthesizing and secreting vital extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagen, proteoglycan, and fibronectin, which contribute to the structural integrity of the kidneys. Additionally, these fibroblasts provide supportive tissues to nephrons (structural and functional units of kidneys), help in regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, along with providing an arena for immune response in case of any infection or damage. They are also integral to the regulation of kidney blood flow and maintenance of tubular structures by stabilizing capillaries through synthesis of angiogenic factors.
Under pathological conditions, such as renal fibrosis, kidney interstitial fibroblasts can transform into myofibroblasts, which speed up the production and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. This overproduction can lead to scar formation and affect the kidney's functionality, often leading to a chronic and progressive loss of renal function.

Their primary role involves maintaining homeostasis and immune surveillance in the kidney microenvironment, defending against ascending urinary infections. Beyond traditional macrophage roles such as phagocytosis and antigen presentation, kidney resident macrophages also contribute significantly to the response to kidney injury including tissue repair and angiogenesis.
Under normal physiological conditions, kidney resident macrophages work to maintain the balance of the kidney's microenvironment by removing dead cells, pathogens and cellular debris, to limit inflammation and tissue damage. They are ‘professional’ phagocytes, clearing pathogens and debris by engulfing and digesting these harmful materials. Moreover, they are capable of presenting antigens to other immune cells, which aids in the activation of the adaptive immune response. 
Kidney resident macrophages show a high degree of plasticity: in response to environmental stimuli they change their morphology and cell surface markers. For example, in response to acute injury, some macrophages adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype and augment tissue damage; once the injury stimulus is removed, they may change to mediate tissue repair. 
While kidney macrophages contribute to wound healing, tissue repair and regeneration by producing key growth factors and cytokines that stimulate cell proliferation, collagen production, and blood vessel formation, dysregulation in their activity can also lead to progressive inflammation and fibrosis, common features in chronic kidney disease.

The epithelial cells lining the connecting tubule are crucial for the journey of filtrate before it empties into urine-collecting ducts and therefore play a critical role in maintaining the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance.
One of the principal functions of connecting tubule epithelial cells involves the selective reabsorption and secretion of various solutes. This reabsorption process includes critical regulatory electrolytes such as sodium ions (Na+), chloride ions (Cl-), and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus playing a role in the regulation of the acid-base homeostasis. Their function also involves the secretion of potassium ions (K+) into the renal tubular fluid.
The connecting tubule epithelial cells are primarily intercalated cells, which can be categorized into two types according to their specific functions: type A intercalated cells, which secrete acid, and the type B intercalated cells, which secrete base (bicarbonate) and reabsorb chloride. By regulating the concentrations of these ions, as well as reabsorption of water, connecting tubule epithelial cells contribute substantively to maintaining the body's electrolyte levels, pH balance, and overall homeostasis.
In addition to intercalating cells, the collecting duct system also has principal cells, which are characterized by the expression of the water channel AQP2. AQP2-expressing cells have also been identified in connecting tubules, but there is some controversy whether these represent a unique cell type as there are some morphologic differences compared with principal cells.

Approximately two-thirds of filtrated sodium and water, nearly all nutrient sugars and amino acids, and a significant portion of bicarbonates pass through the proximal convoluted tubule, are effectively absorbed by the epithelial cells, and reenter the bodily circulation.

Together with the glomerular basement membrane and podocytes, the glomerular endothelial cells form the  glomerular filtration barrier, which is responsible for blood filtration and therefore critical for removal of waste products, such as urea and creatinine, and excess substances, such as glucose and ions, from the bloodstream.

Located before the glomerulus, a tiny, intricate network of capillaries within the nephron, these cells help control the expansion or contraction of the arteriole, thus regulating the pressure and flow of blood into the glomerulus.
Functionally, kidney afferent arteriole cells are largely involved in responding to changes in blood volume and systemic blood pressure. They achieve this by modulating the diameter of the afferent arteriole through a process known as autoregulation. Autoregulation involves two primary mechanisms: the myogenic response and the tubuloglomerular feedback. The myogenic response is essentially the intrinsic ability of the vascular smooth muscle to respond to pressure changes, while the tubuloglomerular feedback is the process where the macula densa cells located near the glomerulus respond to changes in fluid delivery rates in the tubules, sending signals to afferent arterioles to constrict or dilate accordingly. These cells also have significant interaction with renin-containing juxtaglomerular cells, which are located in the wall of afferent arterioles. Juxtaglomerular cells secrete the enzyme renin in response to low blood pressure or sympathetic nerve activity, initiating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system cascade that ultimately helps retain sodium and water to increase blood volume and pressure.

They are the downstream channels that ensure the effective transportation of blood to the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta, critical for maintaining fluid balance and electrolyte homeostasis.
Kidney efferent arteriole cells are exceptional in their ability to perform autoregulation—a critical dynamic control of intrarenal blood flow ensuring stable glomerular filtration rates. This is primarily achieved via myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms, where the cells respond to changes in pressure and the concentration of sodium chloride in the tubular fluid, and constrict or dilate depending on the detected changes.
Cells associated with the efferent arteriole also respond to several systemic influences. Through complex intracellular signaling pathways, they respond to fluctuations in hormones (like angiotensin II and endothelin) and several other mediators such as nitric oxide and prostaglandins. Their adaptive capability helps maintain homeostasis and ensures the entire system's optimal performance under various physiological conditions. Dysfunctions in kidney efferent arteriole cells can lead to severe pathologies like hypertension and chronic kidney disease.

These cells line the descending limb of the loop of Henle, which is a portion of the renal tubule located in the kidneys, an organ responsible for filtering waste products, ions and extra water from the blood and converting them into urine. However, the descending limb epithelial cells are specifically involved in the countercurrent multiplication system, a mechanism to concentrate urine that involves both active and passive transport processes. 
These cells are notably permeable to water but relatively impermeable to solutes, a characteristic that dramatically influences the osmotic gradient in the renal medulla. As filtrate initially descends down the loop of Henle, water gets drawn out due to the increasing osmotic gradient, thereby concentrating the filtrate. Additionally, these epithelial cells are exceptionally thin walled, allowing water to freely diffuse across the membrane.
Furthermore, the kidney loop of Henle descending limb epithelial cells are inextricably linked to the functioning of numerous diuretic drugs, which work by blocking the reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes in the kidneys, leading to increased urine production to rid the body of excess fluids.

The primary function of vasa recta ascending limb cells is to preserve the renal medulla's hypertonicity, necessary for the kidney's urine concentration mechanism. Unlike the vasa recta descending limb cells, the venous-like epithelial cells of the ascending vasa recta are highly fenestrated and lack pericyte coverage, which facilitates water reuptake. 
As the blood flows through the ascending limb, it loses solutes and gains water, which is driven by the high solute concentration in the surrounding interstitium. This process acts in concert with cellular action in the descending limb and contributions from the so-called Loop of Henle, which helps with water and sodium chloride retrieval from the urine.
In the context of normal physiological processes, the function of the vasa recta ascending limb cells is essential in maintaining the body's overall fluid balance, electrolyte concentration, and systemic blood pressure. Any dysfunction in these cells may lead to impaired urine concentration or dilution capability of the kidney, potentially resulting in conditions like diabetes insipidus or hyponatremia.

In contrast to vasa recta ascending limb cells, the arterial-like epithelial cells of the descending vasa recta are non-fenestrated and covered by a pericyte layer that regulates the medullary blood flow. They help keeping the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance in check through a process known as countercurrent exchange system, in which the cells of the descending limb are permeable to water but relatively impermeable to solutes, such as sodium and urea. As the blood descends into the medulla along its descending limb, water passively diffuses out of the vasa recta, concentrating the blood in solutes.
In addition to their central role in water and solute exchange, these cells contribute to maintaining the medullary osmotic gradient, a critical function to concentrate urine. The osmotic gradient is created by the counterflow of water and solutes between the descending and ascending limbs of the vasa recta and the adjacent Loop of Henle. The selective permeability of the descending limb cells allows them to maintain this gradient, which in turn helps to conserve water, a vital role in the overall function of the renal system.

These unique cells are specialized to withstand the highly variable and sometimes harsh conditions present in the urinary system. Their key function is maintaining the barrier integrity of the urinary tract even when exposed to high volumes of urine and its solutes, and they play a crucial role in protecting underlying tissues from damage and infection.
The bladder urothelial cells exhibit a remarkable spectrum of phenotypic versatility and have an extraordinary capacity to stretch and retract based on the degree of bladder filling and emptying. In their relaxed state, these cells appear large and cuboidal, but upon stretching, they become thinner and exhibit a squamous cell-like appearance. This distinctive feature enables them to adjust to the changes in the urinary bladder volume while remaining impermeable to urinary solutes, thereby preventing a potential toxicity to the bladder wall and infiltration into the bloodstream.
Apart from their barrier function, bladder urothelial cells also express a number of sensor molecules or respond to thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli and can release signaling molecules, thereby playing a key role in sensory mechanisms that communicate vital information about the bladder's mechanical state to the nervous system. This communication helps regulate the micturition cycle and maintain urinary continence. Recent studies have also indicated that these cells may play a role in immune responses, highlighting their importance in bladder physiology. 
Altered proliferation and differentiation of bladder urothelial cells are implicated in various diseases and conditions such as bladder cancer, interstitial cystitis, and urinary tract infections.

Urothelial cells form the urothelium – a stratified, transitional epithelium lining the bladder, ureters, renal pelvis and urethra. These cells are highly adapted to their specific environment and maintain the crucial function of sustaining the urinary tract's core roles, primarily to transit and store urine without auto-corrosion or pathogen proliferation.
Within the urethra urothelial cells are primarily found in proximal two-thirds of the urethra, while the distal third is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells. The urothelial cells are renowned for their remarkable impermeability and ability to stretch and recoil during the various stages of urine filling and emptying. They form a tight barrier that prevents reabsorption of harmful byproducts and toxic substances present in the urine, guarding the deeper tissues and bloodstream against potential damage. This is largely attributed to specialized junctions, namely zonulae occludentes or tight junctions, in the umbrella cell layer (one of three layers of the urothelium) that seal the intercellular space between adjacent cells. Together with the urothelial plaque (an apical membrane plaque comprised of uroplakin proteins covering the umbrella cells at the luminal surface), the junctional complexes form a very effective permeability barrier that regulates the passage of water and ion from urine to the underlying tissue. 
A noteworthy feature of urothelial cells is their regulatory and sensory roles involving communication with the underlying layers about the filling and emptying status of the urinary tract. The cells also manage a fine balance between proliferation and differentiation, with the basal cells providing a ready pool of cells to replace the superficial layer when damaged. Their remarkable ability for regeneration and turnover, and their response to signals for repair underpins the durability and functionality of the urothelial tract.

Antidiuretic hormones, such as vasopressin, can stimulate the redistribution of these water channels from an intracellular pools to the apical plasma membrane of the principal cell; translocation of aquaporin (specifically, AQP2) is associated with an increase of osmotic water permeability. The water reabsorption affects the concentration of the final urine; these cells are therefore directly involved in the maintenance of the body's fluid balance.
Kidney collecting duct principal cells also participate in sodium and potassium ions regulation. They reabsorb sodium ions from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream, a process facilitated by the action of aldosterone, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. Similarly, the principal cells secrete potassium ions into the tubular fluid in response to aldosterone, contributing to the regulation of potassium levels in the body.

This unique cell type comes in mainly three subtypes as per the localization of their proton pumps: type A, type B, and non-A, non-B cells. Each subtype plays different roles in regulating acid-base balance and electrolyte homeostasis in the body under varying physiological conditions. 
Type A intercalated cells reabsorb bicarbonate and secrete protons into urine, leading to the production of acidic urine. These cells are typically prevalent on the renal cortex and function particularly in states of metabolic acidosis or potassium depletion. On the other hand, type B intercalated cells secrete bicarbonate and reabsorb protons; thus, they are crucial in alkaline urine production and potassium conservation. These cells are essential to counter metabolic alkalosis or situations of potassium surplus. The non-A, non-B cells have the characteristic features of both type A and B cells, but play a prominent role under conditions of chronically elevated aldosterone and angiotensin II levels. 
Through their differentiated roles, intercalated cells also facilitate the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions, and water to maintain osmolarity.

Projecting dendrites laden with spines, these cells are equipped to receive a wide range of synaptic input, mainly from the cerebral cortex and the thalamus. The \"medium\" and \"spiny\" descriptive parts of the name stem from the neurons' size, which is intermediate when compared to other neurons, and the presence of numerous spines on the dendrites, which serve as critical points for synaptic connections.
The primary function of medium spiny neurons lies within motor control and reward pathways, which are fundamental aspects of the basal ganglia circuitry. They act by receiving and integrating various excitatory and inhibitory inputs to generate a resultant inhibitory output, generally towards other basal ganglia structures. This inhibitory output is crucial to the balance within the basal ganglia system, which regulates voluntary movements, habitual behaviors, and cognitive and emotional functionalities. The medium spiny neurons act through the use of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and express high levels of dopamine D1 or D2 receptors, which facilitate communication within the brain's dopamine system.
Disruptions or malfunctions in medium spiny neurons have been associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. For instance, in Huntington's disease, these neurons display a specific vulnerability, leading to motor control issues, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms. Similarly, these neurons play critical roles in substance addiction, as the neurons' reward pathways can become sensitized or desensitized due to drug abuse.

Originating from the term 'glycine' and 'ergic' (pertaining to activity), glycinergic neurons contain and release glycine which acts on specific receptors, known as glycine receptors, found on the surface of neuron cells. Glycinergic neurons are predominantly found in the spinal cord and brainstem, but also exist in the retina and other parts of the brain.
These neurons are critical to the inhibitory control of neuronal networks, helping to regulate excitation and maintaining neuronal stability. They play a primary role in modulating and controlling motor and sensory information within the nervous system. In general, when a glycinergic neuron fires, it releases glycine, which binds to glycine receptors on a nearby neuron. This binding causes the neuron membrane to hyperpolarize, subsequently reducing the probability of the neuron firing an action potential, which in essence dampens or inhibits the neuron from transmitting further signals. This function plays a vital role in preventing overexcitation, which may lead to neuronal damage or neurodegenerative conditions.
Moreover, glycinergic neurons are integral to certain sensory processes and motor coordination. In the auditory system, these neurons aid in the localization of sound, and in the spinal cord, they are involved in the regulation of motor reflexes and rhythms. Any dysfunction in the glycinergic system can cause serious neurological conditions, such as hyperekplexia, characterized by increased startle responses and periodic bouts of rigidity, and some forms of chronic pain.

They account for approximately 1% of the intestinal epithelial cells in what is known as the largest endocrine organ in the human body. Intestinal enteroendocrine cells exhibit an exceptional diversity, both in terms of their secretory products and their distribution along the intestines, varying from the small intestine to the colon. 
The primary function of intestinal enteroendocrine cells is to maintain gut physiology and homeostasis. They are known for their hormone production and are the source of numerous bioactive molecules including somatostatin, serotonin, cholecystokinin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, motilin, neurotensin, and others. These hormones and neuropeptides act in autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine signaling, impacting various functions including intestinal motility, secretion, nutrient absorption, and gut barrier functions.
Intestinal enteroendocrine cells also serve as the body's frontline of defense, playing an integral role in surveillance against lumen-occurring hazards including pathogen attack. Enteroendocrine cells are divided into ‘closed type’ and ‘open type’. Closed type cells are located close to the basal membrane and do not reach the lumen of the gut. In contrast, the apical side of the open-type intestinal enteroendocrine cells is directly exposed to luminal contents and thus can recognize bacterial metabolites and dietary nutrients. In response, these cells can modulate the immune system responses and thereby function as a key communicator between the gut microbiota and the host.

These cells are located within the complex tubuloalveolar glands that make up the seminal vesicles and are known for their unique pseudostratified columnar epithelium structure. 
The primary function of these cells is the secretion of a variety of substances that ultimately constitute around 70% of the fluid volume of semen. Seminal cells produce a high-fructose fluid that serves as an energy source for the spermatozoa and promotes their motility. They also secrete other essential substances like proteins, enzymes, vitamin C, prostaglandins, and various other compounds. Collectively, these substances help in the nourishment, protection, and transportation of the spermatozoa throughout the male reproductive system and during the ejaculation process.
Secondary to the production of seminal fluid, the seminal vesicle glandular cells also play a role in the contraction of the seminal vesicles during ejaculation. The contraction of these glands, induced by sympathetic nerves, ensures the efficient propulsion of the seminal fluid mixed with spermatozoa into the ejaculatory ducts and subsequently to the urethra. Notably, any malfunction or pathological condition affecting these cells can impact male fertility, emphasizing the importance of understanding the intricate functions of seminal vesicle glandular cells in maintaining the healthy physiological function of male reproduction.

These cells line the inner surface of nearly all blood vessels that irrigate the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of the brain involved with complex cognitive functions such as thought, perception, and memory formation. Cerebral cortex endothelial cells are integral to maintaining brain health and function due to their role in regulating brain microenvironment and controlling the passage of essential molecules and cells.
The endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex are distinctive due to their highly selective permeability, largely attributable to the existence of unique tight junctions which maintain the barrier function of the BBB. The tightly interconnected structures of these cells prevent most substances from freely diffusing into the brain tissue, ensuring that harmful agents such as toxins, pathogens, or peripheral immune cells don't reach the brain and compromise its function. These cells also express multiple transporters and enzymes, allowing the selective entry of necessary nutrients and metabolites while excluding toxic substances.
Cerebral cortex endothelial cells also participate in neurovascular coupling, a process where localized neuronal activity increases cerebral blood flow to satisfy the local metabolic demands. The endothelial cells work in coordination with neurons and other cell types such as astrocytes and pericytes to mediate this process. They have been thought to regulate local blood flow by releasing substances in response to neuronal activity. Additionally, these cells are involved in many pathological conditions. Breakdown or dysfunction of the BBB often marked by altered endothelial cell function is linked to numerous neurological disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and brain tumors.

These newly-transformed myofibroblasts showcase contractile properties similar to smooth muscle cells and play a significant role in wound contraction during the healing process while continuing to produce ECM components to ensure reparative scaffolding. Furthermore, muscle fibroblasts secrete various growth factors, primarily those belonging to the 'Transforming Growth Factor-β' (TGF-β) family, to stimulate muscle repair and regulate immune responses.

They are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into every type of mature blood cell.
Hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into two main lineages: myeloid and lymphoid cells. Myeloid cells can further differentiate into red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body, platelets that contribute to clot formation, and certain types of white blood cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes. These white blood cells play a crucial role in the innate immune response, helping to fight infection and disease. Lymphoid cells develop into other types of white blood cells: T-cells, B-cells, and innate lymphoid cells, which contribute to the cellular and humoral immune response.
Furthermore, the bone marrow hematopoietic cells have a unique ability to replace any blood cell in the body that has been destroyed or lost due to illness or injury. Through this regenerative functionality, they are vitally important to the body's defense mechanisms, disease response, and homeostasis. These cells are used in bone marrow transplants and are of interest in regenerative medicine applications.

These cells are characterized by their distinct pyramidal - triangularly - shaped cell bodies, large size, and long branching dendrites that facilitate extensive interneuronal connectivity. PMCPs, along with other cortical pyramidal cells, are excitatory neurons, meaning they carry electrical impulses away from the cell body, facilitating communication between different areas of the brain and the spinal cord.
The principal function of PMCPs revolves around motor control. PMCPs in the primary motor cortex are responsible for mapping and planning complex movements, from the intention to move to the actual execution. For example, Betz cells are a type of PMCPs that extend their long axons, collectively known as the Corticospinal Tract (CST), which descends from the cortex to the spinal cord, synapsing with neurons in the spinal cord that control muscles throughout the body. This information transmission allows PMCPs to control precise, skillful, and independent movements of both proximal and distal muscles.
Aside from controlling voluntary movement, PMCPs contribute to motor learning and adaptation by establishing new neuronal connections and strengthening existing ones. Studies using techniques like optogenetics and two-photon imaging have revealed that PMCPs undergo significant synaptic plasticity during motor learning, indicating their role in modifying motor outputs in response to training and experience. Overall, PMCPs provide a biochemical and anatomic basis for translating thoughts into actions, an essential process for the organism's interaction with the environment.

Liver DCs, much like other DCs, play a critical role in initiating and directing immune responses. However, they show unique characteristics and functions due to their location in the liver, an organ with an important role in metabolism and immunity.
The liver contains both conventional or classical and plasmacytoid DCs. Liver DCs generally have an immature phenotype and are thought to aid in the maintenance of hepatic tolerance. The liver is constantly exposed to dietary and gut-derived antigens, which requires the liver to strike a balance to avoid excessive immune response against these substances. Liver dendritic cells play an essential role in this balance through various mechanisms, such as promoting the development of regulatory T cells. In some cases, liver DCs have also been demonstrated to exhibit stimulatory activity.
Liver DCs play an important role in liver transplantation outcomes and hepatic diseases including viral infections, carcinomas, and primary biliary cirrhosis.

The epithelial layer functions as a physical barrier that protects the ovarian stem cells and the follicular cells from mechanical stress and potential foreign pathogens, and they provide a supportive tissue microenvironment for the underlying cells of the ovaries.  The OSE is separated from the ovarian stroma by a basement membrane, to which it is only loosely attached. 
OSE cells play a crucial role in ovarian physiology and pathology. They are involved in processes associated with ovarian follicular growth, maturation, ovulation and follicular atresia. Moreover, they have a prominent role in repairing the ovarian surface following the rupture of the follicle during ovulation, essentially playing a key part in the regenerative processes post-ovulation. Shedding and regeneration of OSE cells is a dynamic process that repeats throughout each reproductive cycle.
OSE cells are also the primary origin of ovarian cancer, specifically, epithelial ovarian cancer which accounts for about 90% of all ovarian cancers. The constant rounds of rapid proliferation and repair following ovulation are thought to provide the opportunity for replication errors and hence contribute to neoplastic changes in the OSE.

These L2/3-6 IT neurons project intratelencephalically, implying that their axons interconnect regions within the cerebral hemispheres or between the two hemispheres, particularly to other cortical areas, the striatum, and the claustrum. This feature aids in vital brain functions such as perception, cognition, voluntary motor control, and learning. Importantly, these neurons possess a characteristic pyramidal morphology, which endows them with a high degree of connectivity to other neurons - thereby playing a crucial role in the formation and function of neural networks.
Each specific cortical layer's glutamatergic neuron subtype bears a different function; for instance, neurons in the upper layers (L2/3) generally project to other cortical areas, ultimately assisting in the integration of sensory and motor information across diverse cortical regions. Conversely, the deeper layer neurons (L6) are associated with the modulation of thalamo-cortical input and output, in addition to projecting to the thalamus, reinforcing the complexity and bilateral communication within the cerebral cortex. Thus, the L2/3-6 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron, beyond its role as an excitatory neuron, critically influences a myriad of higher brain functions, reinforcing its importance in studying neurological processes and disorders.

The cerebral cortex, the outermost shell of the brain, is divided into six layers based on the types of neurons they contain and the functions they perform. L5 is known for its characteristic large pyramidal neurons, among which L5 extratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic cortical neurons reside.
Functionally, the primary role of the L5 extratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron is to send signals from the cerebral cortex to other parts of the brain or body apart from the telencephalon - the largest part of the brain that encompasses both cerebral hemispheres. These neurons accomplish this task through their long axons that form connections or synapses with neurons in other subcortical regions. Notably, these neurons are glutamatergic, meaning they release the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is crucial for signaling in the brain as it is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter and plays a crucial role in neural plasticity, learning, and memory.
The L5 extratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron is pivotal in carrying out complex motor activities as the signals they transmit are often directed to areas of the brain responsible for the initiation and modulation of motor functions, such as the spinal cord or the brainstem. Alterations in their structure or function can lead to various neurological disorders like autism, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.

The term “glutamatergic” refers to these neurons releasing the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. This function contributes to the propagation of nerve signals, playing a crucial role in learning and memory procedures.
These specialized neurons project close to their site of origin, specifically within the telencephalon or the largest previous division of the forebrain.

This particular characteristic distinguishes them from the long-range projecting neurons, which can bridge distant regions of the brain.
Functionally, the L5/6 near-projecting glutamatergic neurons play important roles in various aspects of cognitive performances, including motor control, decision making, and sensory processing. Studies have implicated these neurons in action selection and execution, due to their powerful excitatory influence on other neurons within the motor cortex and other parts of the telencephalon. Additionally, the near-projecting neurons play a significant role in the modulation of local cortical circuit dynamics, through their intra-cortical and cortico-striatal projections, further influencing both motor and cognitive functions.

The word 'intratelencephalic' denotes its pattern of connectivity, projecting within the telencephalon, the anterior part of the brain which contains both the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures. These neurons are classified as glutamatergic, as they use glutamate as their main excitatory neurotransmitter. Glutamate is a key player in mediating excitatory synapses in the mammalian central nervous system. Morphologically, these untufted neurons have short apical dendrites and with fewer branches compared to other neurons.
The L6 intratelencephalic projecting neurons play a critical role in motor function and cognitive processes. By releasing glutamate, they stimulate other neurons to which it is connected, directly impacting processes of memory, learning, and synaptic plasticity. The glutamatergic neurotransmission from these neurons shapes the output of the intrinsic cortical microcircuitry and its interaction with other brain regions, subsequently influencing the timing, coordination, and strength of motor commands.
Functionally, the L6 intratelencephalic projecting neurons integrate and transmit the afferent signals coming from the cortical layers above, particularly from the apical dendrites of the pyramidal neurons in layers 2 and 3. As the deepest layer in the six-layered neocortex, L6 contributes extensively to the feedback circuitry, both locally and across distal cortical areas. Despite the limited knowledge available on specific L6 neuron subypes owing to their heterogeneity, it is clear that L6 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic neurons serve as crucial components in the cortex's role as the canonical center for sensorimotor integration and cognition.

GABAergic cortical interneurons expressing both sst and chodl markers play an instrumental role in balancing excitatory neural activities.

Smooth dendrites and a propensity to innervate multiple targets allow these sst chodl GABAergic interneurons to control the output of many principal neurons simultaneously. This regulation results in a balanced state of neuronal activities, preventing any possibility of excess excitations that can potentially lead to brain disorders like epilepsy.
In a broader scope, sst expressing GABAergic cortical interneurons play a pivotal role in the higher cognitive processes. By controlling the timing and synchronization, they play an essential part in shaping the dynamic cortical network activities underlying complex brain functions, such as learning, memory, and attention.
