These cells are undifferentiated, meaning they haven't yet developed into a specific cell type, and they can renew themselves through cell division. As a result, stem cells have the potential to replace damaged or diseased cells in the body, making them a valuable tool in medicine and research.\nThere are two main types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos and can develop into any type of cell in the body. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, are found in various tissues and organs throughout the body and can only develop into certain types of cells.\nStem cells have numerous potential applications in medicine, including the treatment of various diseases and the repair of damaged tissues. For example, they could be used to replace damaged heart tissue after a heart attack or to repair spinal cord injuries. Stem cells also have potential uses in drug development and disease research, as they can be used to model diseases and test potential therapies in vitro.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multipotent cells, capable of differentiating into a wide variety of specialized blood cells. During embryonic development hematopoietic stem cells emerge from the hemogenic endothelium, a specialized subset of endothelial cells with hematopoietic potential. HSCs can be found in several organs, in particular in bone marrow, as well as peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood.\nThese stem cells have a distinctive ability to self-renew, and to differentiate into all lymphoid and myeloid cell types that together form the blood and immune systems including erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and platelets. Their primary function is to ensure the continuous replenishment of the blood and immune system throughout an individual's lifespan.\nIn response to various signals, hematopoietic stem cells can either remain dormant or actively divide and differentiate. Under normal conditions, the majority of these stem cells exist in a quiescent (inactive) state, making them somewhat resistant to chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the treatment of various diseases such as leukemia. However, when the body encounters stress such as infection, bleeding, or disease, hematopoietic stem cells can rapidly become active in order to replenish the affected cells and maintain homeostasis.\nFurthermore, hematopoietic stem cells are extremely important in the field of regenerative medicine and transplantation. Regarded as lifesaving in the field of oncology, they are often extracted, purified, and reinfused back into the same (autologous transplantation) or different (allogeneic transplantation) individuals to reestablish a healthy, functioning hematopoietic and immune system after high-dose chemotherapy or to replace dysfunctional bone marrow. Understanding and manipulating the behavior of these stem cells has immense potential in treating various blood disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancers.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "Erythroid progenitor cells play a key role in the hematopoietic system, specifically in the process of erythropoiesis – the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes). Found within the bone marrow, these cells are dedicated precursors to erythrocytes, and ensue in the hematopoietic lineage from multipotent progenitors. They represent a transitional cell type that bridges the gap between the early-stage erythroid precursors and the maturing red blood cell population.\nThe earliest committed erythroid progenitor cell is thought to be the burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cell, which after several cell divisions gives rise to another erythroid progenitor, the colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cell. \nErythroid progenitor cells are primarily responsible for responding to the demand for new red blood cells during conditions of physiological stress like infection, blood loss, or illness. This responsive behavior is regulated by a glycoprotein hormone known as erythropoietin, which is produced by the kidneys. Erythropoietin interacts with the receptors on the erythroid progenitor cells, prompting them to proliferate and differentiate into erythroblasts. The erythroblasts then further mature, eventually producing new, functional red cells.\nThe role of erythroid progenitor cells extends beyond their main function of erythrocyte production, as they also participate in maintaining the balance of iron in the body. Upon erythroid differentiation, they increase their uptake of transferrin-bound iron for hemoglobin synthesis, a vital component of red blood cells which allows them to transport oxygen. A deficiency or excess of erythroid progenitor cells can lead to extensive health issues such as anemia or polycythemia respectively, emphasizing their crucial role in human health.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

This part of the hematopoiesis process leads to the formation of myeloid lineage cells, which includes granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes, erythrocytes (red blood cells), and megakaryocytes (platelet-forming cells). \nThe primary function of common myeloid progenitors is differentiation and proliferation into various types of mature blood cells, thereby providing a critical contribution to maintaining homeostasis within the body's immune and circulatory systems. Single-cell analyses have shown that the CMP cell population is heterogeneous with at least two distinct subpopulations, characterized by different cell surface markers and likely already committed to downstream differentiation into either the granulocyte/macrophage lineage or the megakaryocyte/erythrocyte lineage-restricted progenitor. \nThe destiny of a CMP is influenced by numerous cytokines and growth factors in its environment that promote differentiation along specific lineages. For example, IL-3 and GM-CSF stimulate the production of eosinophils, which are essential for the body’s defense against allergens and help fight fungal and parasitic infections. \nBy being able to differentiate into a wide range of different immune cells, common myeloid progenitors play a crucial role in the body's ability to respond to injuries, infections, and other physiological challenges.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "The megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP) cell belongs to the multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells, which can give rise to multiple different cell types. They are found in the bone marrow, the primary organ where new blood cells are generated. MEPs are specially programmed to develop into two distinct blood cell lineages, namely megakaryocytes, which go on to produce platelets for blood clotting, and the erythroid lineage which consists of red blood cells responsible for oxygen transport in the body.\nThe MEP cells are the result of a decision-making process within the hematopoietic stem cell population. Hematopoietic stem cell can differentiate into multiple types of progenitor cells, including myeloid progenitor cells. A further subdivision within this myeloid lineage generates the MEP cells. Therefore, these megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors represent a key juncture between hematopoietic stem cells and mature blood cell types in the myeloid lineage.\nMegakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells play a crucial role in the homeostasis of some of the most crucial constituents of blood. The megakaryocytes produced from these bipotent progenitor cells contribute to hemostasis by producing platelets - small anucleated fragments that are pivotal for blood clotting and preventing bleeding.

These cells play a crucial role in the secretion, absorption, and transport of fluids depending on the organ they inhabit. They are typically organized in a tubular structure, forming collectively the conduit for the transport of substances. These cells exhibit tight junctions, enabling the careful regulation of the passage of substances and ensuring that no unwanted particles seep through. They are predominantly characterized by their polarized nature, having distinct apical and basolateral surfaces that support its functions of secretion and absorption. The apical surface, exposed to the duct lumen, is specialized for secretion and interaction with the luminal environment, while the basolateral surface is oriented towards the underlying tissue, facilitating interactions with neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix.\nThe ducts serve as the bridge between the gland and the site of secretion, allowing the substances produced by the gland to exit into the body. Thus, duct epithelial cells have a sweeping role in various physiological functions, ranging from defense against pathogens in the respiratory and digestive tracts, to secretion of digestive enzymes, to milk production in mammary glands.\nAs a result of their specialized function, any impairment in the function of duct epithelial cells to function properly often leads to certain diseases or disorders. Studies have identified potential correlation between malfunctioning duct epithelial cells and conditions such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and certain cancers, particularly breast and pancreatic.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells form a single, continuous monolayer inside every blood vessel, acting as a crucial biomolecular barrier between the blood, and the rest of the body tissues. They perform various fundamental biological functions, ranging from maintenance of vessel integrity to blood clotting regulation. Additionally, they control the transportation of fluids, molecules, and blood particulate matter from and into the bloodstream.\nOne of the primary functions of blood vessel endothelial cells is to maintain vascular homeostasis - a stable environment within the blood vessels. They accomplish this through several methods: they control vasomotor tone, i.e. the degree of contraction and dilation of blood vessels, by secreting vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide and endothelin; mediate responses to inflammatory stimuli; and they also regulate angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formations. Blood vessel endothelial cells play a significant role in preventing blood clot formation by generating a slick, non-thrombogenic surface that disallows platelets or coagulant proteins from adhering to it.\nBlood vessel endothelial cells are sensitive to various stimuli, including shear stress caused by blood flow, and they can respond by altering their morphology, function, and gene expression. This ability to adapt enables blood vessels to remodel and ensure the adequate delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues, regardless of physiological demand variations. Conversely, endothelial dysfunction, often associated with a reduction in the bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, can lead to the development of pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and even aging-related diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

comment: From FMA: 9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard].

However, in adults, MSCs are found in multiple tissues, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, the umbilical cord, and dental tissues. \nThe primary function of MSCs is to maintain and repair the tissues in which they are found. When damage occurs, the MSCs are able to migrate to the site of injury, where they aid in regenerating the damaged tissue by differentiating into the required cell type and by secreting growth factors that enhance tissue repair and reduce inflammation. Furthermore, MSCs can also act as immunomodulators, suppressing immune reactions and reducing inflammation, both locally and systemically.\nApart from their role in tissue maintenance and repair, MSCs are integral to the field of regenerative medicine and are being investigated for their therapeutic potential in various clinical settings. Owing to their multipotent nature, immunomodulatory activity, and the relative ease of isolation, these cells can be engineered and translated into therapies to treat a variety of diseases, including bone and cartilage defects, liver diseases, heart disorders, and autoimmune diseases, amongst others.

property_value: terms:description "Smooth muscle cells are a specialized type of muscle cells that are primarily found within the walls of hollow organs such as the intestine, stomach, bladder, uterus, and blood vessels. These cells are an essential component of the autonomic nervous system controling involuntary movements within the body.\nSmooth muscle cells play a vital role in many physiological processes due to their unique functionality. They can contract and relax in a slow, sustained, and controlled manner to help modulate the size and shape of the lumens of the organs they surround. For example, in the digestive system, coordinated contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells propels food along the gastrointestinal tract - a process known as peristalsis. In the blood vessels, the smooth muscle cells, by contracting or relaxing, either constrict or dilate the vessels, which in turn, help regulate blood flow and pressure.\nOn a cellular level, smooth muscle cells possess a single, centrally located nucleus and contain an arranged network of actin and myosin filaments, which are the proteins responsible for muscle contraction. Unlike their counterparts in skeletal or cardiac muscles, these cells lack specific contact points for these filaments, hence the lack of visible striations. Furthermore, the contraction of smooth muscle cells is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, adding an additional layer of complex regulation to these highly specialized cells.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

The main function of erythrocytes is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and organs, and to transport carbon dioxide from the body's tissues to the lungs, where it can be exhaled out of the body. Hemoglobin, a protein located inside erythrocytes, is responsible for binding to oxygen. \nErythrocytes are produced in the bone marrow and have a lifespan of approximately 120 days before they are broken down and recycled by the body. Erythrocytes are regulated by the hormone erythropoietin, which is produced by the kidneys and liver in response to low oxygen levels in the body, thereby stimulating erythrocyte production .\nIn addition to their role in oxygen transport, erythrocytes also play a key role in regulating the body's pH levels. Without erythrocytes, oxygen would not be able to be transported efficiently throughout the body and tissues would not receive the necessary oxygen to function properly. Overall, erythrocytes are essential for maintaining the health and homeostasis of the body.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Beyond mere structural support, these cells are instrumental in wound healing, inflammation, and maintaining tissue integrity. They may also influence the behavior of other cell types through direct cell-cell interactions or paracrine signaling.\nClinically and in research, stromal cells often draw attention due to their interaction with tumors in the cancer microenvironment.

Smooth muscle myoblasts arise from the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, a process tightly regulated by specific genetic factors and environmental signals. Their role extends to myogenesis, particularly in the formation of muscular tissue, especially during embryonic development.\nSmooth muscle myoblasts possess distinctive cellular characteristics. In contrast to skeletal muscle myoblasts, they do not fuse to create multinucleated fibers. Instead, they differentiate into individual, uninucleated smooth muscle cells. This differentiation unfolds in two distinct phases: proliferation, marked by rapid division to increase cell numbers, and differentiation, involving structural and functional transformation into mature smooth muscle cells. This intricate process is intricately mediated by various signaling molecules and transcription factors.\nFunctionally, smooth muscle myoblasts and the mature muscle cells they generate play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Smooth muscle cells orchestrate involuntary muscle responses and are integral to body systems that regulate blood flow, propel food along the digestive tract, and control airflow in the respiratory tract. These diverse functions underscore the significance of smooth muscle myoblasts in the body's growth, maintenance, and overall function.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "A megakaryocyte is a large, unique, and complex cell type found primarily in the bone marrow, the spongy, semi-solid tissue located in the medullary cavities of certain bones. The term ‘megakaryocyte’ is derived from the Greek 'mega', meaning great, and 'karyon', referring to the nucleus. Megakaryocytes are characterized by their large size, typically with a diameter of 50-100 µm in humans, and the presence of a multilobulated nucleus; they are the largest hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow but also the rarest cells. \nThe primary function of a megakaryocyte is the production of platelets, also known as thrombocytes. Platelets are small, anucleate cell fragments that play a crucial role in the process of hemostasis, the arrest of blood loss from a damaged blood vessel. The process begins when the megakaryocyte extends long, branching processes called proplatelets, into the sinusoidal blood vessels present in the bone marrow. These proplatelets then fragment into the discoid structures recognized as platelets. Each megakaryocyte can produce thousands of platelets during its lifespan. \nApart from platelet production, megakaryocytes are involved in several other functions. They express immune-sensing receptors such as Fc-γ receptor and Toll-like receptors and produce factors such as platelet factor 4 and platelet-derived growth factor that can stimulate the immune system. Also, in certain pathological conditions, megakaryocytes release TGF-β and PDGF and contribute to bone marrow fibrosis, a condition characterized by excessive accumulation of fibrous tissue in the bone marrow leading to anemia. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of megakaryocytes in regulating hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell production. They can influence the bone marrow microenvironment and control the behavior of hematopoietic stem cells, the progenitors of all types of blood cells.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "Mesangial cells are specialized cells that primarily reside in the middle layer, or mesangium, of the renal glomerulus within the kidney. The primary function of mesangial cells is to maintain the structural stability and function of the glomerular capillary tuft. They achieve this by providing structural support to the capillary loops, controlling the surface area available for filtration in response to physiological alterations in blood pressure, and removing trapped material and proteins from the basement membrane, which otherwise could cause damage. Moreover, mesangial cells regulate the glomerular blood flow by contracting and relaxing, similar to smooth muscle cells. They also synthesize extracellular matrix components, including collagen and fibronectin, that form the structural framework of the glomerulus.\nBeyond their structural and regulatory roles, mesangial cells are involved in several immunologic functions. They express a variety of receptors that can recognize immune complexes and subsequently mediate an inflammatory reaction. Their role in the immune response includes the production of a variety of cytokines and growth factors, which make them a key cellular component in the progression of several renal diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "Fenestrated cells are specialized epithelial cells that are characterized by a distinctive structural feature, fenestrations or tiny pores, which allow an exchange of substances such as fluids, nutrients, and waste between blood vessels and the surrounding tissue environments. These cells are present in various types of epithelial tissues in the human body, including the intestinal tract, endocrine glands, and certain parts of the renal system. \nThere are multiple types of endothelial cell fenestrations. The most common type is found in systemic capillaries of the endocrine tissue (e.g., pancreatic islets), gastrointestinal mucosa, and renal peritubular capillaries. Here, the fenestrated cells have fenestrations in their peripheral cytoplasm with a unique thin and permeable diaphragm that provides a high degree of selectivity, blocking the passage of larger molecules while allowing the free movement of smaller ones. In contrast, other types of fenestrations, such as the discontinuous epithelium of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, do not have diaphragms. \nCharacteristically, fenestrated cells play a vital role in the filtering process of body systems. They are a key part of the glomeruli in the kidneys where blood is filtered under high pressure. The fenestrations present in the endothelial cells lining the capillaries of the glomerulus allow the free passage of water and small solute molecules towards the Bowman's capsule, leaving behind larger proteins and cells in the blood, thereby aiding in the filtration and waste removal process. \nIn the endocrine system, fenestrated cells in glandular capillaries allow the prompt release of hormones into the bloodstream. These cells have tightly clustered fenestrations which increase the surface area available for passive diffusion, improving the efficiency of hormone secretion. In villi of the small intestine, these cells increase absorption efficiency, permitting the exchange of water, electrolytes, and nutrients.\nOverall, fenestrated cells contribute immensely to important physiological processes of filtration, absorption, and secretion, primarily connecting our body's circulation system with the surrounding tissues and organs.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They are an essential component of the neurovascular unit, a structure critical for maintaining brain homeostasis and a consistent neural microenvironment.\nPericytes play a crucial role in the regulation of microvascular blood flow and permeability. They dynamically respond to changes in blood flow and can relax or contract like smooth muscle cells, thereby controlling capillary diameter and blood flow to the tissues. Moreover, pericytes contribute significantly to the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration, implying their vital role in angiogenesis and the stability of blood vessels. Their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells, reveals their importance in tissue repair and remodeling.\nFurthermore, pericytes have demonstrated functions in regulating immune and inflammatory responses. Pericytes also collaborate with endothelial cells in preserving the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, thus protecting the central nervous system from potential damage due to harmful substances and pathogens.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Their responsiveness to signals such as insulin-like growth factors, transforming growth factor-β, and neural inputs enables precise control over their proliferation and differentiation. This regenerative capacity equips them with the ability to repair injured or damaged muscle tissue, a critical function in preserving muscle homeostasis and overall function.

For instance, hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow exhibit multipotency, giving rise to all blood cell types. Conversely, muscle stem cells display unipotency, generating only muscle cells.\nSomatic stem cells respond to environmental signals that regulate their quiescence, activation, and differentiation states. In response to tissue injury, they proliferate and differentiate into specific mature cell types to replace lost or damaged cells. Intricate mechanisms ensure a delicate balance between self-renewal and differentiation, guiding tissue maintenance and repair without risking aberrant cell proliferation leading to tumor formation.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells have a unique, flattened shape, and are tightly bound together, forming a thin layer known as the endothelium. The endothelium is responsible for maintaining the interior surface of blood vessels, and plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth flow of blood. \nVascular endothelial cells act as a semi-permeable membrane, controlling the passage of materials and the transit of white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. These cells are also involved in blood coagulation. When a blood vessel is damaged, endothelial cells promote clotting to prevent excessive bleeding and facilitate wound healing. Other functions include regulation of blood pressure and blood volume by releasing vasodilators and vasoconstrictors to either widen or constrict blood vessels, accordingly.\nFurthermore, the endothelial cells are crucial in the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. This is particularly important in wound healing and the growth of new tissues during development or after injury. In the context of diseases such as cancer, angiogenesis helps facilitate tumor growth by providing nutrients and oxygen.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "Capillary endothelial cells are particularly essential in the formation and function of capillaries - the smallest and most widespread blood vessels in the body. They play two primary roles: barrier function and transport function. Acting as barriers, they strictly control the passage of nutrients, gases, biological molecules, and cells between the blood and the surrounding tissues. This function not only provides a protective shield to internal organs against potentially harmful substances but also regulates the fluid and solute exchange. In terms of transport, these cells facilitate the diffusion of oxygen and essential nutrients from the bloodstream into the tissues. Concurrently, they allow waste products like carbon dioxide to pass from tissues into the bloodstream for removal, making these cells exceptionally instrumental in maintaining the body’s homeostasis.\nMoreover, capillary endothelial cells are also actively involved in numerous other physiological processes such as inflammation, blood clotting, and angiogenesis. During inflammation, they can specifically express and secrete molecules to attract white blood cells to sites of damage. Similarly, in blood clotting, they produce substances that prevent blood cells from sticking to the vessel wall and deter the formation of unnecessary clots. In angiogenesis, they proliferate and organize the formation of new blood vessels, crucial for wound healing and embryonic development. The disruption of their function contributes to pathological conditions like edema, thrombosis, and several cardiovascular diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule have a cuboidal shape and microvilli that increase surface area, facilitating effective reabsorption.\nThe primary function of epithelial cells of the proximal tubule revolves around their ability to reabsorb approximately 60-70% of the glomerular filtrate, retaining essential substances such as sodium, glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, and certain ions that are filtered out by the glomerulus. Additionally, these cells are also responsible for the secretion of organic acids, bases, and the hydrolysis of small proteins that are reabsorbed after filtration. \nProximal tubule epithelial cells are highly susceptible to apoptosis, and damage to these cells by exposure to toxins, pathogens, or obstructive conditions may result in acute kidney injury.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "Renal principal cells are the major cell type in the initial collecting tubule and the cortical and outer medullary collecting ducts, as well as the connecting tubule, in the nephrons of the kidneys.\nA key function of renal principal cells is the regulation of water balance in the body. These cells express aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels, which facilitate the reabsorption of water from the fluid within the renal tubule lumen back into the blood. The translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane is controlled by the hormone vasopressin: In response to high vasopressin levels, AQP2 moves to the cell membrane, allowing water to pass through effectively and be reabsorbed, therefore concentrating the urine. Conversely, in low vasopressin conditions, AQP2 is removed from the membrane, reducing water reabsorption and diluting the urine. \nRenal principal cells are also involved in the regulation of sodium and potassium levels in the body. They have sodium channels (ENaC) in their luminal membranes which permit the reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubule fluid back into the blood, resulting in a net reabsorption of sodium ions into the systemic circulation. This process is controlled, in part, by the hormone aldosterone. Additionally, renal principal cells contain potassium channels that facilitate the secretion of potassium ions into the urine. The activities of these channels, in coordination with other cell types in the nephron, are critical for maintaining electrolyte balance and overall body homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Each kidney holds approximately one million nephrons, each of which is composed of several distinct parts, including the renal corpuscle, the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal tubule. All sections are lined with highly specialized epithelial cells adapted to perform different functions within the sections of the nephron. \nThe different epithelial cells of the nephron play crucial roles in the process of filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, essential tasks for the regulation of body fluid composition and volume. During filtration, the blood is forced through the walls of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule, where waste products, electrolytes, and water are separated from the blood cells and proteins. As the filtrate then passes through the nephron, epithelial cells of the tubular portion reabsorb useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes, along with most of the water back into the bloodstream. Waste products like urea and creatinine, as well as excess ions and water, remain in the tubule for elimination.\nIn addition, epithelial cells of the nephron also play a vital part in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by actively secreting hydrogen ions into the urine while reabsorbing bicarbonate from the urine back into the blood. They are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and contribute to erythrocyte production by releasing the hormone erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. Abnormalities or damage in renal epithelial cells often result in impaired kidney function, leading to various renal diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells play a significant role in maintaining kidney structure and orchestrating key physiological procedures related to kidney function.

Additionally, these fibroblasts provide supportive tissues to nephrons (structural and functional units of kidneys), help in regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, along with providing an arena for immune response in case of any infection or damage. They are also integral to the regulation of kidney blood flow and maintenance of tubular structures by stabilizing capillaries through synthesis of angiogenic factors.\nUnder pathological conditions, such as renal fibrosis, kidney interstitial fibroblasts can transform into myofibroblasts, which speed up the production and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. This overproduction can lead to scar formation and affect the kidney's functionality, often leading to a chronic and progressive loss of renal function.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "Kidney connecting tubule epithelial cells are found in collecting duct system of the kidney, specifically in at the interconnection segment between the nephron and the collecting ducts. The epithelial cells lining the connecting tubule are crucial for the journey of filtrate before it empties into urine-collecting ducts and therefore play a critical role in maintaining the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance.\nOne of the principal functions of connecting tubule epithelial cells involves the selective reabsorption and secretion of various solutes. This reabsorption process includes critical regulatory electrolytes such as sodium ions (Na+), chloride ions (Cl-), and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus playing a role in the regulation of the acid-base homeostasis. Their function also involves the secretion of potassium ions (K+) into the renal tubular fluid.\nThe connecting tubule epithelial cells are primarily intercalated cells, which can be categorized into two types according to their specific functions: type A intercalated cells, which secrete acid, and the type B intercalated cells, which secrete base (bicarbonate) and reabsorb chloride. By regulating the concentrations of these ions, as well as reabsorption of water, connecting tubule epithelial cells contribute substantively to maintaining the body's electrolyte levels, pH balance, and overall homeostasis.\nIn addition to intercalating cells, the collecting duct system also has principal cells, which are characterized by the expression of the water channel AQP2. AQP2-expressing cells have also been identified in connecting tubules, but there is some controversy whether these represent a unique cell type as there are some morphologic differences compared with principal cells.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: terms:description "Kidney distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells, often referred to simply as distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells, constitute a significant portion of the nephron -- the functional building unit of the kidney involved in filtration and reabsorption of substances from blood. The DCT epithelial cells form lining of the distal convoluted tubule, a segment of the nephron located after the loop of Henle and before the collecting tubule. These cells are characterized by unique morphological features such as small size, low height and fewer microvilli compared to proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells. \nThese cells perform a host of vital functions contributing to the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte balance, blood pressure and pH. While the DCT is less prominent in water and sodium reabsorption compared to the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle, it plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the process. DCT epithelial cells are responsible for the final adjustments of sodium, potassium and calcium reabsorption, thereby affecting overall fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation and bone health. The reabsorption process is regulated by hormones including aldosterone and parathyroid hormone.\nThe distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also plays a significant role in acid-base homeostasis by secreting protons (H+) into the tubular fluid and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), thus regulating the pH of the blood. The ability of DCT cells to adjust urine concentration plays a part in maintaining the body’s pH balance and preventing conditions like acidosis or alkalosis. In summary, kidney distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells perform functions that are crucial to maintaining body's homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Each cell exhibits a unique array of adhesion molecules, receptors, and secreted mediators which interact with circulating blood cells and solutes. \nOne of the key functions of kidney capillary endothelial cells is enabling filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion – the crucial steps in the formation of urine. In the glomerulus, these cells form a collaborative relationship with the podocytes to constitute the glomerular filtration barrier; here, the ultra-thin endothelial cells create a wall through which water and small solutes pass while retaining larger proteins and molecules within the bloodstream. This permits the rapid and selective filtration of plasma, a primary aspect of the kidney's role in waste clearance and fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base homeostasis.\nKidney capillary endothelial cells also conduct multiple homeostatic roles, such as vasomotor control, fibrinolysis, platelet adhesion, inflammation, and coagulation. They also play a crucial role in responding to renal injury by participating in fibrogenesis, an initial response following acute kidney injury. The endothelial cells spearhead angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) and the repair and regeneration of renal tissue, thereby enhancing the survival function of the kidney itself. Furthermore, factors secreted by kidney capillary endothelial cells also help control the growth and differentiation of other types of renal cells.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

However, the descending limb epithelial cells are specifically involved in the countercurrent multiplication system, a mechanism to concentrate urine that involves both active and passive transport processes. \nThese cells are notably permeable to water but relatively impermeable to solutes, a characteristic that dramatically influences the osmotic gradient in the renal medulla. As filtrate initially descends down the loop of Henle, water gets drawn out due to the increasing osmotic gradient, thereby concentrating the filtrate. Additionally, these epithelial cells are exceptionally thin walled, allowing water to freely diffuse across the membrane.\nFurthermore, the kidney loop of Henle descending limb epithelial cells are inextricably linked to the functioning of numerous diuretic drugs, which work by blocking the reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes in the kidneys, leading to increased urine production to rid the body of excess fluids.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

Translation is mediated by the ribosome, and begins with the formation of a ternary complex between aminoacylated initiator methionine tRNA, GTP, and initiation factor 2, which subsequently associates with the small subunit of the ribosome and an mRNA or circRNA. Translation ends with the release of a polypeptide chain from the ribosome." [GOC:go_curators]

def: "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

def: "A biological process is the execution of a genetically-encoded biological module or program. It consists of all the steps required to achieve the specific biological objective of the module. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

def: "Any biological process that results in permanent cessation of all vital functions of a cell. A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538)." [GOC:mah, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, PMID:25236395]
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation, it is currently kept in GO as a placeholder for describing cell death phenotypes in uPHENO. When information is provided on a programmed cell death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or GO:0006915 'apoptotic process'). Unintentional cell death, i.e. cell death caused by injury, ageing, or cell phenotypes observed as a result of a pathological mutation in an essential gene should NOT be annotated using GO terms.

comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children.

name: sexual reproduction
namespace: biological_process
def: "A type of reproduction that combines the genetic material of two gametes (such as a sperm or egg cell or fungal spores). The gametes have an haploid genome (with a single set of chromosomes, the product of a meiotic division) and combines with one another to produce a zygote (diploid)." [Wikipedia:Sexual_reproduction]
comment: Note that gametes may come from two organisms or from a single organism in the case of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, e.g. C. elegans, or self-fertilization in plants. Note also that sexual reproduction may be seen as the regular alternation, in the life cycle of haplontic, diplontic and diplohaplontic organisms, of meiosis and fertilization which provides for the production offspring. In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times.

def: "A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together." [GOC:dos, GOC:mah]
comment: A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.

comment: Note that the definition allows for experimentally-manipulated genes, and allows for artifically-produced derivatives that mimic those found naturally. Note also that the definition excludes protein complexes, which some also consider a protein. Those who wish to refer to a class representing both senses of the word are directed to PR:000064867 ("protein-containing molecular entity"). Proteins (in the sense defined here) that descended from a common ancestor can be classified into families and superfamilies composed of products of evolutionarily-related genes. The domain architecture of a protein is described by the order of its constituent domains. Proteins with the same domains in the same order are defined as homeomorphic [PRO:WCB).

def: "A protein that is a translation product of the human CD34 gene or a 1:1 ortholog thereof. It is a leukocyte membrane protein expressed specifically by lymphohematopoietic progenitor cells. It contains a single-pass transmembrane domain and that show distinct expression on early hematopoietic precursors and vascular-associated tissue. Acts as a scaffold that presents selectin carbohydrate ligands in a clustered, tissue specific manner to allow for higher avidity interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells during the inflammatory process. In common with related sialomucins (endoglycan and podocalyxin), the extracellular region is dominated by an N-terminal mucin-like domain, which is densely substituted with sialylated O-linked carbohydrates. The mucin-like region is followed by a cysteine-containing and presumably globular domain. This domain may fold into an immunoglobulin-like structure as the positions of 2 of the cysteines are conserved in the C2 set of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The cytoplasmic domain is around 73-76 residues long and highly conserved." [PMID:16720896, PMID:8983065]

For example, the surface of the shell of a muscle has a distinct shape that projects into the third dimension. Note that boundaries are 2D structures. They have no thickness - and so can not be sites of gene expression or gene product localisation. For this, use boundary region terms.

def: "The second stage of the kidney. It serves as the main excretory organ of aquatic vertebrates and as a temporary embryonic kidney in higher vertebrates. It is composed of the mesonephric duct (also called the Wolffian duct), mesonephric tubules, and associated capillary tufts. A single tubule and its associated capillary tuft is called a mesonephric excretory unit; these units are similar in structure and function to nephrons of the adult kidney. The mesonephros is derived from intermediate mesoderm in the vertebrate embryo." [GO:0001823, Wikipedia:Mesonephros]

It lacks chambers and endocardium.... The innovation of the chambered heart was a key event in vertebrate evolution, because the chambered heart generates one-way blood flow with high pressure, a critical requirement for the efficient blood supply of large-body vertebrates... all extant vertebrates have hearts with two or more chambers (Moorman and Christoffels 2003)" DOI:10.1101/gad.1485706

A nephron eliminates wastes from the body, regulates blood volume and blood pressure, controls levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulates blood pH. Its functions are vital to life and are regulated by the endocrine system by hormones such as antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, and parathyroid hormone.[WP]." [PMID:9268568, Wikipedia:Nephron]

def: "A flexible rod-shaped body found in embryos of all chordates. It is composed of cells derived from the mesoderm and defines the primitive axis of the embryo. In some chordates, it persists throughout life as the main axial support of the body, while in most vertebrates it becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube." [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499, https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/25, https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/271, ISBN:0815318960, Wikipedia:Notochord]
comment: The notochord appears early in embryogeny and plays an important role in promoting or organizing the embryonic development of nearby structures. In most adult chordates the notochord disappears or becomes highly modified. In some non-vertebrate chordates and fishes the notochord persists as a laterally flexible but incompressible skeletal rod that prevents telescopic collapse of the body during swimming[TOLWEB]

name: blood island
def: "Blood islands are structures in the developing embryo which lead to many different parts of the circulatory system. They primarily derive from plexuses formed from angioblasts. Within them, vacuoles appear through liquefaction of the central part of the syncytium into plasma. The lumen of the blood vessels thus formed is probably intracellular. The flattened cells at the periphery form the endothelium. The nucleated red blood corpuscles develop either from small masses of the original angioblast left attached to the inner wall of the lumen or directly from the flat endothelial cells. In either case the syncytial mass thus formed projects from and is attached to the wall of the vessel. Such a mass is known as a blood island and hemoglobin gradually accumulates within it. Later the cells on the surface round up, giving the mass a mulberry-like appearance. Then the red blood cells break loose and are carried away in the plasma. Such free blood cells continue to divide. Blood islands have been seen in the area vasculosa in the omphalomesenteric vein and arteries, and in the dorsal aorta[WP, unvetted]." [Wikipedia:Blood_island_of_umbilical_vesicle]

name: nephrogenic mesenchyme
def: "Nephrogenic mesenchyme is the tissue made up of loosely connected mesenchymal cells in the nephron." [GO:0072076]
comment: The detailed events associated with the differentiation of the nephrogenic mesenchyme are somewhat complex. It has been suggested that each terminal branch of the ureteric bud stimulates the associated cap mesenchyme tissue to form a renal vesicle (the most primitive stage of nephron development: a stage I nephron). This then elongates, becomes a comma-shaped and then an S-shaped body (stage II nephron), and makes contact with and fuses with the distal component of the ureteric bud. The latter then forms the collecting duct. One fold of the S-shaped body gives rise to Bowman's capsule (also termed the glomerular capsule). Soon afterwards, endothelial cells invade to make a capillary knot-like outgrowth, the glomerular tuft, which goes on to form the glomerulus. The inner epithelial layer of the Bowman's capsule (also called the visceral epithelium, or podocyte layer because it consists of podocytes) is closely apposed to the endothelial glomerulus. Together, the Bowman's capsule and the glomerulus comprise the definitive renal corpuscle. The rest of the nephron elongates to form components of the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle and the distal tubule. The distal pole of the developing nephron connects to the ureteric bud that induced it at an early stage of nephron/ collecting duct development, before differentiation of the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle and the distal tubule are complete. This connection allows the excretory products produced by the kidney to be removed and subsequently transferred, via the ureter, into the bladder where they are stored until it is appropriate to empty the bladder.

These vessels do not anastomose with each other, but form what are called end-arteries. In their outward course they give off lateral branches; these are the afferent vessels for the renal corpuscles; they enter the capsule, and end in the glomerulus. From each tuft the corresponding efferent vessel arises, and, having made its egress from the capsule near to the point where the afferent vessel enters, breaks up into a number of branches, which form a dense plexus within Bowman's capsule."

comment: The notochordal process grows cranially until it reaches the prechordal plate, the future site of the mouth. In this area the ectoderm is attached directly to the endoderm without intervening mesoderm. This area is known as the oropharyngeal membrane, and it will break down to become the mouth. At the other end of the primitive streak the ectoderm is also fused directly to the endoderm; this is known as the cloacal membrane (proctodeum), or primordial anus.

Ligaments are more stretchy and contain more elastic fibers than tendons. Dense connective tissue also make up the lower layers of the skin (dermis), where it is arranged in sheets."

The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

comment: This relation has a stronger meaning than merely indicating that X may develop into Y, in that the capability of developing into Y is always present, even if X does not always actually develop into Y. In particular, this means that if Y is restricted to a given taxon T, X is necessarily likewise restricted.

def: "relation that links two events, processes, states, or objects such that one event, process, state, or object (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (an effect) where the cause is partly or wholly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly or wholly dependent on the cause." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality]
property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
