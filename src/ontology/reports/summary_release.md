| connective tissue cell (CL:0002320) | A cell of the supporting or framework tissue of the body, arising chiefly from the embryonic mesoderm and including adipose tissue, cartilage, and bone. |                  A cell of the supporting or framework tissue of the body, which includes adipose tissue, cartilage, and bone. In vertebrates, this cell arises chiefly from the embryonic mesoderm and, in cranial regions, from neural crest. |
| circulating fibrocyte (CL:0000135) | An inactive fibroblast; cytoplasm is sparse, endoplasmic reticulum is scanty with flattened nucleus. Term used by some histologists; when fibroblasts become relatively inactive in fiber formation. However, this cell has the potential for fibrogenesis in quiescent connective tissue of the adult, as well as during development, other histologists prefer to use the term fibroblast in all circumstances. These cells represent ~0.5% of peripheral blood leukocytes. |                  A bone marrow-derived cell that predominantly develops from myeloid lineage-restricted progenitor cells and circulates in peripheral blood, characterized by co-expression of hematopoietic markers CD45 and CD34 along with stromal markers including collagen type I in both humans and mice (Chesney et al., 1997; Blakaj and Bucala, 2012). This spindle-shaped cell exhibits a unique dual identity, functionally bridging immune and stromal compartments with characteristics of both monocytes and fibroblasts. Predominantly arising from circulating monocytes, it migrates to injury sites via chemokine receptors and participates in wound repair through extracellular matrix deposition, cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation via MHC class II. As mesenchymal progenitors, fibrocytes can differentiate into fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and adipocytes, contributing to both physiological repair and pathological fibrosis (Blakaj and Bucala, 2012). |

They have a central cell nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. Tendon cells have a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and they are responsible for synthesis and turnover of tendon fibres and ground substance. |                  An elongated fibroblast that is part of a tendon. Its cytoplasm is stretched between the collagen fibres of the tendon, and it possesses a central nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. Tendon cell has a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, and it is responsible for the synthesis and turnover of tendon fibres and ground substance. |

| juxtacanalicular tissue cell (CL:7770002) | A trabecular meshwork cell of the juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT), characterized by a spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like morphology within a loose extracellular matrix immediately adjacent to Schlemm's canal. It expresses CHI3L1 (human and mouse) and ANGPTL7 (human), as well as smooth muscle actin for contractility. Unlike other trabecular meshwork cells, it does not form monolayers but exists in a loose network, regulating aqueous humor outflow resistance through continuous ECM remodelling, mechanotransduction, and formation of intracellular pores historically called giant vacuoles. |
| sst GABAergic interneuron (Homo sapiens) (CL:4072027) | A transcriptomically distinct GABAergic neuron located in the cerebral cortex that expresses somatostatin (sst). The standard transcriptomic reference data for this cell type can be found on the CellxGene census under the collection: 'Transcriptomic cytoarchitecture reveals principles of human neocortex organization', dataset: 'Supercluster: MGE-derived interneurons', Author Categories: 'CrossArea_subclass', cluster Sst. |

Predominant in the submandibular glands of humans and mice, its differentiation and secretory gene expression are regulated by FGFR2b–MAPK signaling, driven by paracrine FGF7 from adjacent myoepithelial cells, which provides a key niche signal for seromucous identity. |

This intrinsic property enables it to maintain oscillatory activity even when isolated from other neurons. It populates the brainstem, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, spinal cord, and cerebellum. It plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, generating respiratory rhythms in the preBötzinger complex, and synchronizing neural networks. |
| suprabasal cell (CL:7770004) | An epithelial cell that resides in the layer(s) immediately above the basal layer in stratified or pseudostratified epithelia. This cell mainly originates from basal cells and is found across various tissues, including skin, esophagus, oral mucosa, airway, and cornea. |
| mucosal-associated invariant T cell, human (CL:0020002) | A mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell found in various tissues including human blood, liver, gut, and lung, characterised by a semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) comprising TRAV1-2 (Vα7.2) predominantly paired with TRAJ33, and high expression of CD161.

This cell has the capacity to differentiate into ciliated and secretory epithelial cells, as well as potentially endothelial/stromal lineages. Positioned at the apex of lineage bifurcation, the cell exhibits stem-like and endothelial features, representing an intermediate developmental state between undifferentiated progenitors and lineage-committed epithelial cells. |
| L6 intratelencephalic projecting Car3 glutamatergic neuron (Homo sapiens) (CL:4072040) | A transcriptomically distinct intratelencepalic-projecting glutamatergic neuron that expresses Car3 with a soma found in L6. The standard transcriptomic reference data for this cell type can be found on the CellxGene census under the collection: 'Transcriptomic cytoarchitecture reveals principles of human neocortex organization', dataset: 'Supercluster: IT-projecting excitatory neurons', Author Categories: 'CrossArea_cluster', L6 IT Car3. |
| internal globus pallidus core projecting neuron (CL:0020003) | A projection neuron that has its soma located in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) of primates, in the central “core” region. It expresses parvalbumin, is primarily GABAergic, and projects to motor thalamic nuclei including the ventral anterior, ventrolateral, and ventromedial nuclei. This neuron corresponds to the sensorimotor output population of the GPi, as demonstrated in human tissue and cross-species comparative studies (Wallace et al., 2017) and by classic tracing in primates (Parent & De Bellefeuille, 1982; Parent et al., 2001). |
| L5 extratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron (Homo sapiens) (CL:4072043) | A transcriptomically distinct glutamatergic neuron, with a soma found in the deeper portion of L5, that has long-range axonal projections including deep subcortical targets outside of the telencephalon and, in some cases, the spinal cord. While the L5 ET neuron projections are not limited to ET targets, they are clearly differentiated from the neuron subclasses whose projections are constrained to intratelencephalic (IT) targets. L5 ET neurons are generally the largest excitatory cortical neurons, typically having a thick apical dendrite with a prominent dendritic tuft in layer 1 and displaying burst-firing physiological characteristics. The standard transcriptomic reference data for this cell type can be found on the CellxGene census under the collection: 'Transcriptomic cytoarchitecture reveals principles of human neocortex organization', dataset: 'Supercluster: Deep layer (non-IT) excitatory neurons ', Author Categories: 'CrossArea_subclass', clusters L5 ET. |

It projects primarily to the lateral habenula (Parent & De Bellefeuille, 1982; Wallace et al., 2017), forming the limbic/aversive output stream of the GPi. |

| L4 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic neuron (Homo sapiens) (CL:4072039) | A transcriptomically distinct intratelencephalic-projecting glutamatergic neuron with a soma found in cortical layer 3-4. This neuron type can have a pyramidal, star-pyramidal or spiny stellate morphology and projects its output to L2/3 and L5A/B. The standard transcriptomic reference data for this cell type can be found on the CellxGene census under the collection: 'Transcriptomic cytoarchitecture reveals principles of human neocortex organization', dataset: 'Supercluster: IT-projecting excitatory neurons', Author Categories: 'CrossArea_subclass', L4 IT. |
| mucous acinar cell of salivary gland (CL:4052066) | An acinar cell of the salivary gland, responsible for producing a viscous, mucin‐rich solution, thereby facilitating lubrication and protection of the oral mucosa. This cell is characterized by an elongated shape, clear cytoplasm filled with mucin granules, and a basally compressed nucleus (Barrows et al., 2020). In humans and mice, the mucous acinar cell predominates in the sublingual gland and minor salivary glands, while also being present in mixed glands such as the submandibular gland, where it coexists with serous acinar cells (Maruyama et al., 2019). |
