CL:0000449 : brown fat cell   
OLD: A cell from the thermogenic form of adipose tissue found in newborns of many species, including humans, and in hibernating mammals. Brown fat is capable of rapid liberation of energy and seems to be important in the maintenance of body temperature immediately after birth and upon waking from hibernation.
NEW: A cell from the thermogenic form of adipose tissue found in many species,  particularly in newborns and hibernating mammals, but also in lesser amounts in adults of other mammals including humans. Brown fat is capable of rapid liberation of energy and seems to be important in the maintenance of body temperature immediately after birth and upon waking from hibernation.


CL:0000598 : pyramidal neuron   
(was pyramidal cell)
OLD: A projection neuron in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. Pyramidal cells have a pyramid-shaped soma with the apex and an apical dendrite pointed toward the pial surface and other dendrites and an axon emerging from the base. The axons may have local collaterals but also project outside their cortical region.
NEW: Pyramidal neurons have a pyramid-shaped soma with the apex and an apical dendrite pointed toward the pial surface and other dendrites and an axon emerging from the base. The axons may have local collaterals but also project outside their  region. Pyramidal neurons are found in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala.


CL:0000816 : immature B cell   
OLD: An immature B cell is a precursor B cell that has the phenotype surface IgM-positive and surface IgD-negative, and have not undergone class immunoglobulin class switching or peripheral encounter with antigen and activation.
NEW: An immature B cell is a B cell that has the phenotype surface IgM-positive and surface IgD-negative, and have not undergone class immunoglobulin class switching or peripheral encounter with antigen and activation.


CL:1001571 : hippocampal pyramidal neuron   
OLD: A pyramidal cell of the hippocampus.
NEW: A pyramidal neuron of the hippocampus.
