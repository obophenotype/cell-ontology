They are the result of an experiment in using Rector normalisation to fix problems in CL arising from hand maintenance of polyheirarchy.  They import just subsets of various ontologies.  Those subsets (fma.owl; ro.owl) are all now out of date.  Nevertheless - it may be useful to refer to the definition patterns used in future work on CL.
