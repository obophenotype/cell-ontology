# Introduction to Continuous Integration Workflows with ODK

Historically, most repos have been using Travis CI for continuous integration testing and building, but due to
runtime restrictions, we recently switched a lot of our repos to GitHub actions. You can set up your repo with CI by adding 
this to your configuration file (src/ontology/cl-odk.yaml):

```
ci:
  - github_actions
```

When [updateing your repo](RepoManagement.md), you will notice a new file being added: `.github/workflows/qc.yml`.

This file contains your CI logic, so if you need to change, or add anything, this is the place!

Alternatively, if your repo is in GitLab instead of GitHub, you can set up your repo with GitLab CI by adding 
this to your configuration file (src/ontology/cl-odk.yaml):

```
ci:
  - gitlab-ci
```

This will add a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your repo.
