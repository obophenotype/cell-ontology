# Contact Us

## GitHub
The preferred point of contact for the Cell Ontology is the GitHub [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/). It is used commonly for requesting new terms or suggesting changes to existing terms. Feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/new/choose) with any kind of request/question/consideration you might have. 

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can sign up for a free account [here](https://github.com/).

## E-mail and other contacts

The Cell Ontology also has a [Slack Channel](https://anatomy-and-cell-onto.slack.com) and monthly meetings, with an [open agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XvMbNvr0FEsdqGhg79BYCYEHSqUxRHMcvhbGizEAht8/edit). 

If you want to join the channel or talk about any other topics related to the Cell Ontology, you may reach out to one of the active CL editors. 
The official contact for CL listed at the OBO Foundry is [Alexander Diehl](mailto:addiehl@buffalo.edu), but feel free to contact any other individual. A list of active CL editors can be found [here](http://obophenotype.github.io/uberon/team/).

Note that requests on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/) may be addressed more quickly, as individuals are often busy.

For other details on CL, you may see [http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cl.html](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cl.html).
