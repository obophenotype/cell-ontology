## A guide to defining cell types

For most cell types, editors using this guide should add simple subClassOf restrictions following the guidance here. When asserting subClassOf axioms, you should be as specific as you are comfortable with, given what you know about the cell type being defined, but it is OK to be vague as long as you do not assert anything you know to be false. EquivalentClass axioms need to be added more cautiously. Vague assertions must be avoided and some judgment is needed. Ideally most use of EquivalentClass axioms should restricted to the addition of terms following standard design patterns in DOSDPs (relevant patterns are linked from this guide), either using pattern-based generation or using patterns as a reference. More occasionally manual addition of EquivalentClass axioms not following any predefined patterns may be justified and safe, but you should be prepared to justify why it is safe on any associated ticket and are encouraged to seek review from other editors. You should then create a new DOSDP template to record this pattern for future editors.
